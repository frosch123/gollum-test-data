===Advanced patch options===
YAPP has several options not accessible through the patch settings window. These are saved in your [[en/openttd.cfg]] and
can be changed either with a text editor or through the in-game [[en/console]] using the "patch" command. Changes made in openttd.cfg '''will not''' affect
already started savegames, you have to use the console to change the values of a running game.
* pf.wait_for_pbs_path (Set this value to 255 if you don't want trains to ''ever'' turn around at a pbs signal on their own.)
* pf.path_backoff_interval (Increase if you have a slow computer. Set to 255 to disable path look-ahead if you don't want to use advanced signals.)
* pf.npf.npf_rail_pbs_cross_penalty
* pf.npf.npf_rail_pbs_signal_back_penalty
* pf.yapf.rail_pbs_cross_penalty
* pf.yapf.rail_pbs_station_penalty
* pf.yapf.rail_pbs_signal_back_penalty
* pf.yapf.rail_doubleslip_penalty

==Features==
* Works with NPF and YAPF.
* Implements a signal system similar to [[en/Archive/Community/Realistic Path Based Signalling|Tekky's proposed PBS system]] (without realistic bi-directional double track).
* Is fully backwards compatible, normal and PBS signals can be used in parallel.
* Can highlight the reserved paths.
