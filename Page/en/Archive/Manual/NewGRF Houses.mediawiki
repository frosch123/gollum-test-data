'''NewGRF Houses''', known colloquially as '''Newhouses''', is a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] feature for [[en/Manual/Main Page]] that allows support of GRF files which use this feature. Newhouses is far more advanced than simple image replacement, as it also changes buildings statistics. 

==History==
Before the advent of newhouses, GRF authors could only replace existing graphics to create new buildings. Now, however, new buildings can be added as well as replacements, allowing for a much more diverse look to towns and cities.

The original feature was created by Csaboka for [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] and by a number of developers, including [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Maedhros]], [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Belugas]] and [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Peter1138]] for OpenTTD.

==GRF Sets==
Currently there are few Newhouses sets available, the most notable being the [[en/Total Town Replacement Set]] by Zimmlock. There are also several known to be in development, such as [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird|PikkaBird's]] Urban Renewal, and [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Michael Blunck|Michael Blunck's]] Diversa.
