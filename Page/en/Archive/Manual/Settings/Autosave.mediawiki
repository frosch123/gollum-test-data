[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Autosave]]


The Autosave option allows OpenTTD to automatically save your game at predefined intervals. This greatly lessens the annoyance of making a serious error in your game and not having saved it yourself beforehand. You can set this in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]]. There are five selections to choose on how often the Autosave feature will save your game (value of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] variable "autosave" in brackets):

* Off (never)
* Every month (monthly - 1st day of each month)
* Every 3 months (quarterly - 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, and 1st October)
* Every 6 months (2x yearly - 1st January and 1st July)
* Every 12 months (yearly - 1st January)

Each time one of the above dates is reached ingame, a new save file will be created in the "autosave" subfolder of your save directory, with the name "autosaveX.sav" (where X is the lowest integer that hasn't already been used). Autosave triggers in all games, including multiplayer.
