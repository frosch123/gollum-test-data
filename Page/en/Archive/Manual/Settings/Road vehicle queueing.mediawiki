[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing]]


This patch allows road vehicles to queue for a bus station that is busy, rather than driving around in circles whilst waiting for a free space.
Although this is useful, traffic jams can build up into gridlock if you've not planned carefully.
Use of [[en/Manual/Loading Bays|multi-stops]] can also avoid traffic jams.
