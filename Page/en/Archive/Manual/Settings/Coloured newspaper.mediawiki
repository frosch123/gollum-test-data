[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Coloured newspaper]]


A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that changes the date when coloured newspaper messages are being displayed.

== Description ==
This patch is a purely cosmetic change that allows the newspaper messages to be printed in colour after a certain date, supposedly to coincide with the use of coloured ink in newspaper printing. If you would like to be accurate to real life, the '80s are a good time to start.

== Use ==
This feature is set to 2000 by default. You can change it through either the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy|configure patches -> Economy]] window for versions 0.6.x and previous, the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#Coloured_news_appears_in|Advanced Settings -> Interface]] window in versions 0.7.x and later, or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
colored_news_year = 2000</pre>
