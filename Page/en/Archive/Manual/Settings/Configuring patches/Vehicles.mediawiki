====Enable realistic acceleration for trains====
{{en/Feature|-0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.2 to 0.6.3)}}
Enables a more [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] calculation for trains. With this setting enabled, trains will travel faster up hill, but slower through tight corners.
This option has been renamed to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles#train-acceleration-model|Train acceleration model]] in 0.7.0.

====Forbid trains and ships to take 90 deg turns====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.4.0)}}
Disallows trains from making sharp 90 degree turns. The NPF or YAPF pathfinder needs to be enabled for this option. Note that due to the way the AI constructs rail paths, certain AI routes will become uncompleteable.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([patches] gotodepot = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for trains====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}

{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Select the pathfinding algorithm for road vehicles. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders. This option has been renamed from [[#use-yapf-for-roadvehs|Use YAPF for roadvehs]].

{{en/-}}
====Pathfinder for ships====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Select the pathfinding algorithm for ships. The original is the default and recommended setting, but you can select newer pathfinder. YAPF for ships has the advantage of not having to use buoys for long distances, but has serious performance issues when using a large number of ships (i.e. more than ten). This option has been renamed from [[#use-yapf-for-ships|Use YAPF for ships]].
