====Enable New AI (alpha)====
{{en/Feature|-0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.4 to 0.6.3)}}
Whether the [[en/Archive/Development/New AI]] is enabled or disabled.

====Allow AIs in multiplayer (experimental)====
{{en/Feature|0.4|align="right"|text=(since 0.4.5)}}
Enables new AI in multiplayer games (requires to have Enable New AI (alpha) on)
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' (ai_in_multiplayer = <true|false>)

====Disable trains for computer====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.2)}}
The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build [[en/Manual/Trains]], it will not build tracks either. If [[#enable-new-ai-alpha|the new AI is '''enabled''']], disabling [[en/Manual/Trains]], [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], and [[en/Manual/Ships]] will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three).
This option has been moved from [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#disable-trains-for-computer|Vehicles section]] in 0.3.4.

====Disable road vehicles for computer====

The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses]], it will not build roads either. If [[#enable-new-ai-alpha|the new AI is '''enabled''']], disabling [[en/Manual/Trains]], [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], and [[en/Manual/Ships]] will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three).
This option has been moved from [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#disable-road-vehicles-for-computer|Vehicles section]] in 0.3.4.

====Disable aircraft for computer====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.2)}}
The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], it will not build aeroports either. If [[#enable-new-ai-alpha|the new AI is '''enabled''']], disabling [[en/Manual/Trains]], [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], and [[en/Manual/Ships]] will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three).

====Disable ships for computer====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.2)}}
The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build [[en/Manual/Ships]], it will not build ship docks either. If [[#enable-new-ai-alpha|the new AI is '''enabled''']], disabling [[en/Manual/Trains]], [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], and [[en/Manual/Ships]] will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three).
This option has been moved from [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#disable-ships-for-computer|Vehicles section]] in 0.3.4.
