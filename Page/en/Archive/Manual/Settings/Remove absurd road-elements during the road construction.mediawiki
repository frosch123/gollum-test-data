[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Remove absurd road-elements during the road construction]]


Makes the [[en/Manual/Local authority#fund-local-road-construction|local road reconstruction]] program actually do something.  When this patch is active, after road works are finished in a road tile, unnecessary road pieces are removed.  Unnecessary road pieces are those leading into buildings, water, uncrossable railroads, etc.
