==Advanced Settings window: Construction section==
The Construction section allows you to set various options related to construction and terraforming. The purpose of the available settings is explained below. For each setting, the respective variable from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg|config file]] is listed with it's possible values.

===<u>Signals</u>===
====Show signals on the drive side====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Whether signals are shown on the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Show signals on the drive side|side]] that road vehicles drive on or the opposite.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] signal_side = <true|false>)

====Enable the signal GUI====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
With this patch enabled, clicking on the [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button will result in the opening of an extra signal toolbar, which allows you to pick certain types of signal (semaphore, light signal, [[en/Manual/Signals]]) directly without having to cycle trough them using the CTRL-key. Using CTRL to select your signal types is still possible when this patch is enabled.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([gui] enable_signal_gui = <true|false>) 
{{en/-}}
====When dragging, place signals every====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.4)}}
When using the "Autorail" style of dragging signals (or when autocompleting signals using ctrl+drag), you can set their density (place on every Xth tile) with this setting. The number of empty track squares is equal to the set value minus one.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''1 tile'''</span> to <span style="color:#00693E">'''20 tiles'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([gui] drag_signal_density = <num_val>) 
{{en/-}}
====Automatically build semaphores before====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Makes semaphores (old style signaling) the default placed signals until the year you have configured in this patch.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:red">'''0'''</span> to <span style="color:#00693E">'''5,000,000'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([gui] semaphore_build_before = <year>) 
{{en/-}}
====Signal type to build by default====
{{en/Feature|0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.7.0)}}
Set the type of signal to be built by default when using the signal tool. Choose between [[en/Manual/Signals#Block_signals|block signals]], [[en/Manual/Signals#Path_Signals|path signals]] and one-way path signals. If the [[#Enable the signal GUI|signal GUI]] is enabled, this type of signal is selected by default.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''Block signals'''</span>, <span style="color:#00693E">'''Path signals'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''One-way path signals'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([gui] default_signal_type = <0-2>)
{{en/-}}
====Cycle through signal types====
{{en/Feature|0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.7.0)}}
Set which type of signal should be cycled through when ctrl-clicking on a ready-built signal. Choose between cycling through all [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] types, just the [[en/Manual/Signals#Block_signals|block signals]] types or only the [[en/Manual/Signals#Path_Signals|path signals]] types.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''Block signals only'''</span>, <span style="color:#00693E">'''Path signals only'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''All'''</span>

===Allow building on slopes and coasts===
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Normally you can only [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|build tracks and roads on slopes]] parallel to the incline, with this setting enabled you can build nearly everything on a slope with foundations being built automatically.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] build_on_slopes = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}
===Allow landscaping under buildings, tracks, etc. (autoslope)===
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
This patch makes the terraforming restrictions far less severe and allows you to terraform under objects, where you normally would need to remove the object first. Note that canals and some NewGRF objects will still prevent foundations from being changed around them even with this setting enabled.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] autoslope = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}

===Allow removal of more town-owned buildings, roads, bridges, etc===
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.3)}}
The townâ€™s attitude is more lenient towards you [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Extra dynamite|removing]] their property.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] extra_dynamite = <true|false>) 
{{en/-}}

===Maximum bridge length===
{{en/Feature|1.1|align="right"|text=(since 1.1.0)}}
Allows you to specify longest bridge length, longer than originally intended. Replaced "Allow very [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges|long bridges]]".

'''Note:''' With some NewGRFs, depending on the current year, building too long a bridge will throw an error even though the target bridge length is shorter than this setting's value.

===Maximum tunnel length===
{{en/Feature|1.1|align="right"|text=(since 1.1.0)}}
Allows you to specify longest tunnel length, as above.  No previous similar feature.

===Airports never expire===
{{en/Feature|1.0|align="right"|text=(since 1.0.0)}}
Airports may have an expiry year, similar to engines. Expired airports can't be built any more. With this option enabled, airports never expire.

This option has been renamed from [[#Always allow small airports|Always allow small airports]] in r16614.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([station] never_expire_airports = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}

===Enable terraforming the tiles at the map borders===
{{en/Feature|0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.7.0)}}
With this enabled, the map isn't required to have water all around it and allows you to terraform the map's edges just like any place elsewhere. Selecting this feature also provides an extra set of buttons in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Terra Genesis Perlin|map generator]] to select the type of edge (water/freeform) for each side of the map.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] freeform_edges = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}

===In game placement of trees===
{{en/Feature|1.0|align="right"|text=(since 1.0.0)}}
With this option, you can enable/disable the in-game generation of trees.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:red">'''none''' (breaks lumber mill)</span>, <span style="color:#00693E">'''only in rain forests'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''everywhere'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] extra_tree_placement = <0-2>)
{{en/-}}

==In previous versions==
===Always allow small airports===
{{en/Feature|-0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.2 to 0.7.5)}}
Small airports are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Always allow small airport|not removed]] from the airport construction list when large airports appear. With this option disabled, you no longer can build small airports as soon as larger airports become available.

This option has been renamed to [[#Airports never expire|Airports never expire]] in r16614.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([station] always_small_airport = <true|false>) 
{{en/-}}

===Allow building very long bridges===
{{en/Feature period|Old|1.0|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Allowed you to build very [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges|long bridges]]. Now it is replaced with [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 1.1.0#1.1.0-beta5 .282011-02-04.29|custom maximum bridge and tunnel length setting]]. 
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([construction] longbridges = <true|false>)
