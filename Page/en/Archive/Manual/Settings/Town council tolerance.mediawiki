'''town_council_tolerance''' is a variable of Openttd.cfg file:

Sets the city council's attitude toward area restructuring in the game.  A player rated "poor" or worse by the council will not be allowed to place stations or demolish town roads, bridges or buildings.  The less tolerant the council is set to be, the faster their rating will fall due to the demolition of town assets (including trees on otherwise open land).  The council's rating will improve over time by effectively moving freight, mail and people to and from stations in the town's area of control.<br><br>
0 = permissive<br>
1 = tolerant<br>
2 = hostile<br>
