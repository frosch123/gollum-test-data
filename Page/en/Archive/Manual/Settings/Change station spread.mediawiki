A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that allows you to change the maximum size of a station.

==Description==
The station spread is the maximum distance between two station tiles in the same station. There is a limit to how spread a station is allowed to be. If the station already covers this amount of tiles in a certain direction, you cannot add any other part to the station in this direction. With this patch you can change the maximum station size to anything between 4 and 64 tiles, the maximum value being the same as the longest train you can have. Be careful if you are not using the [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] pathfinding though: The game will slow down and then become unstable when you set this to a value higher than the default of 12.

==Use==
The default station spread is 12. You can change this value through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations#max-station-spread|configure patches -> stations]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
station_spread = 12</pre>
