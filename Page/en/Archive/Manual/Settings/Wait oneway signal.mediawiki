[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Wait oneway signal]]


Sets the wait-time in seconds for one-way [[en/signals]]. After this time-out, trains will turn around to see if there is an alternative route. 

Possible values are between 2 and 255. A value of 255 is special as it indicates that a train wait forever at the signal without turning.
