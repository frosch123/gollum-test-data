[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Full load any cargo]]


A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that changes the loading behavior of [[en/trains]] to make them leave a station if any cargo type is full. 

== Description ==
When you [[en/Manual/Orders|order a train]] to load at a station, it normaly waits there until every cargo type is full. Let's say you have a train with 5 passenger wagons and 2 mail wagons. Even if it can't hold any more passengers the train would wait until all the mail vans are full as well. Use this patch to disable this behavior.

== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. You can disable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations|configure patches -> stations]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
full_load_any = false</pre>
