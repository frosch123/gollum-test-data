'''snow_line_height''' is a variable of Openttd.cfg file:

This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] allows you to determine at what "altitude" snow will appear.  

After a certain height of tile, all tiles are drawn as snow tiles. This patch enables you to adjust the height above which all tiles will become snow tiles.

The number is the height in tiles above which snow will cover the ground.
