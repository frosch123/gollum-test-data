[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Player name]]

{{en/note|Newer versions call this option <code>client_name</code>}}
<br><br/>
This property defines the name you will have when you play [[en/multiplayer]]. It is considered polite not to leave the name as 'Player'. It doesn't have to be anything special - possibly your nickname, forename, or initials. Use your imagination. This name identifies you to other players in a [[en/multiplayer]] game and is useful for identifying senders of [https://wiki.openttd.org/Multiplayer#Chatting messages] or in [https://wiki.openttd.org/Multiplayer#Client_list sending players money].
<br><br/>
When first joining a multiplayer game your [[en/Manual/Transport company]] will likely be named after you (e.g. if you set your name to "Jeff" then your company will be "Jeff" Transport by default).

= Changing your name =
To change your name during a game, the <code>name</code> [[en/console]] command can be used.
To do this, open the console and type <code>name "<newname>"</code>, replacing <newname> with your new name.

= Other differences =
The player name that you set sometimes replaces the town that you built in first (i.e. "Blah" Transport instead of Gilwood Transport)
