[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Wait for pbs path]]


Sets the wait-time in days for a path reservation. After this time-out, trains will turn around to see if there is an alternative route. 

Possible values are between 2 (default is 30) and 255. A value of 255 is special as it indicates that a train wait forever at the signal without turning.
