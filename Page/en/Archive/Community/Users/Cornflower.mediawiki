Hello! Welcome to my user page. I am known as [http://www.tt-forums.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=24855 Cornflower] at most websites, though out there on other sites, there are other people who have beat me to the name.


== About ==

I am an avid player of OpenTTD & Locomotion, and have produced new items for either game, though I may have not released any of my work for OpenTTD, most likely will release some once I have felt that I have finished it, or am waiting for permission in the case of derivative works.

== Licensing ==

I normally release my work under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0] license, or a special license that I have written myself, usually to be similar to the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ CC-BY-NC-ND] license, but restricting hosting of the said work. This is mainly the case of software, to help protect the public from a malware forgery.
