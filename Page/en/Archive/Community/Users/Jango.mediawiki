== Who am I? ==
Like many of the others here, I've played everything TT, including the TTO demo when it first came out! It was refreshing to see such a project like OpenTTD out of the miry pits of many other TT-style replacements. So, I'm a [x] year old, living in London, UK. I've just finished studying Computer Science at University College London, and now I'm [y]. For me, OpenTTD is a project where I can release my ideas on how a transport sim should work, and also, it's a way of developing my programming skills further.
