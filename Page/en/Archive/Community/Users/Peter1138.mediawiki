== TODO ==

Stuff which is necessary

* Give the mini-map window some attention. It is horrible with many cargoes or industries available.

Stuff to add

* Freeform docks, probably already patches available for this
* Related engines, grouping of engines to expose related models or liveries in a user friendly manner (not cargo subtypes!)
* [[en/Peter1138/RoadLanes]]

== Stuff ==

* Korenn's [[en/Community/Essays/Peter1138's Towngrowth Challenge]] (OCS)
* VarAction2able [[en/Peter1138/NewBridges|bridges]] some day?
* NewGRF controlled [[en/Archive/Development/Railtypes|rail types]] and [[en/Archive/Development/Old NewGRF roadtypes 1|road types]] perhaps...
* NewGardens
* More bullet points
