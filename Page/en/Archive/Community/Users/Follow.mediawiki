My name is Jan Slupski.

* I wrote initial support for [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=9111 Train list sorting]. Maybe it will be finshed someday.
* I advocate of [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=9352 new autorenew feature]

=== My private wish (TODO?) list ===
* proper flooding of everything (also from map sides)
* track improvements
** diagonal bridges
** signals on the bridges, on the stations
** signals on the crossings ??
** turn ramps
** mulitilevel bridges
** soft slopes (not to slow down trains)
* train loading order (fifo)
* use debt to compute company value, dividents from 25-75% owned company
* (partially?) underground station

=== My private Howto ===
==== Kill access keys ====
* Tired of pressing Ctrl-W and toggling ''Watch page'' (instead closing current tab), etc., etc.
