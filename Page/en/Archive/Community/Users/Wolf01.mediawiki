= Wolf01's Wiki Page =
Hi, I'm Daniele, formally know as Wolf01, I'm an Italian TT player, I love to develop patches, draw sprites and play, but the best thing I'm really able to do is the third one :P.<br>
I like more OpenTTD than TTDPatch, not because one is better than the other but because the different feeling I have with both games.<br>
I mantain a site and a forum dedicated to the TT world (and other things, because I don't have only one love :D), it is in Italian language and you can find it here: [http://transporttycoon.game-host.org http://transporttycoon.game-host.org] or here [http://wolf01.game-host.org http://wolf01.game-host.org] (which is the same, but with the "old name", the new one I think it might have more visibility).<br>
If you want to contact me to talk about everything I'm interested on, feel free to do it (check how to at contacting me)

== Projects ==
=== NRT ===
Allow to define more road types with GRFs, each one with its own properties and graphics.<br>
Currently in development.<br>
See also: [[en/Archive/Development/NotRoadTypes Flags|NRT Ponies]]

=== FlatDocks ===
Allow docks to be build on flat canals instead of a slope.<br>
Brainstorming.

=== NotWater ===
Some changes on how traffic on water is handled, changes many water related features such as locks, ship collisions...<br>
Brainstorming.

=== Remove globals ===
Move the globals into static classes so they can be accessed with methods which allow better control of what's happening in the game, specially in the game state (now uses 2 or 3 variables) and configuration.<br>
Some work done.
