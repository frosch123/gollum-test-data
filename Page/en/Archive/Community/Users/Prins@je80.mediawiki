(Used to be) Fanatic player of Transport Tycoon. When Transport Tycoon de Luxe came out, it became even better! The creation of TTDPatch just revolutionised the game. But to get a stand alone version that runs under Linux is the best! So, I'm now playing OpenTTD when I've got time.

Though, I must say, time is short. I'm an Astronomy PhD student, which might be a reason for lacking time...
