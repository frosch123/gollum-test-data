Hello. You'll know me better as [http://www.tt-forums.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=9805 Dave on TT-Forums]. ("Dave" wasn't a valid username on OpenTTD's system, so I've added my hometown of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stourbridge Stourbridge] instead.)

===I'm overseeing the new Aesthetics section of the [[en/Manual/Main Page|OpenTTD Manual]]. Please PM me on the forums if you'd like to be involved!===
