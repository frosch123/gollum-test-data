==Who i am?==

Ophelia's mind went wandering.

You'd wonder where she goes;

Through secret doors, down corridors.

She wanders there alone...

All alone.

( Natalie Merchant )


You may question my Sanity.

You may question my Wisdom.

You may question my Authority.

You even may question my Beliefs and Opinions.

But never question my Intelligence.



Sadly, all too often, stating that oneself is intelligent is seen as Delusions Of Grandeur.

Even if is it a rational Conclusion from experiencing the World around us.


“Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities.

The latter cannot understand it when [someone] does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary

prejudices but honestly and courageously uses [ones own] intelligence.”

( Albert Einstein )
