'''Started playing TTD:''' 1996 XD

'''Joined #openttdcoop:''' June 2007

'''Specialist on:''' Attention to detail, eyecandy, building networks that drive on the left.

'''A bit about me:''' I'm quite new to the OTTD scene, and even newer to Coop, however, I understand quite a bit (or so I'd like to think) and I'm happy to help out any newer players. Sometimes I prefer the new players as they lack the strictness of the oldies ^_^

'''Prefers:''' Futuristic games

'''What to do if you encounter this player:''' LittleMikey may legally be an adult, but he behaves and thinks like a twelve year old. Remember this, let him have the shiny round object when he asks for it, and he wont bother you. Also, he tends to have a short temper when it comes to lack of icecream, so be careful of that.
