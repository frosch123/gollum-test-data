Yes, it's me. Played TTD the last millennium, and now try it again.

Other "games" I regularly play (links to external pages):
* [https://factorio.com/ Factorio]
* [https://www.zusi.de/ Zusi 3 Hobby] (for me the best train simulator for players who want a realistic simulation of german routes and trains, but definitely not "eye candy")
* [https://live.dovetailgames.com/live/train-simulator Train Simulator] by Dovetail, Steam edition (not as realistic, but global railways and quite nice to watch)
