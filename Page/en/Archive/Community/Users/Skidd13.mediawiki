=== About me ===
I first mingled with OpenTTD during my vocational training to a MaTA in 2004.
After a while I wanted to help the community to improve the game. My first real contribution are the depot icons which I drew. ''(Inspired by Born Acorn and Bot_40. Give credit where credit is due.)''

=== My stuff that went into trunk ===
* Sprites:
** Icons of the depot gui
** Icons of the vehicle group gui
** Various other icons
* Features:
** Skip to order
** Move to order
** Town road layouts
** Random road layouts
** Town road cleanup
** Rewrite the town growth
* fixes, comments, coding style things

=== Ended drawing projects ===
* US HQ's
* Combined Airport GRF
* Sprites for North American Roadset

=== Stuff that I work on ===
* Coding:
** Code-cleanup and code-consolidation of the basic internals
* Drawing:
** Sprites for the NewGRF_ports branch (I'm sorry for the very slow process due to the lack of a muse)
