==Jupix Writes About Himself==

I have been an OpenTTD contributor for about 5 years at the time I'm writing this. I've done some scenarios, some very minor programming and graphics stuff, but mostly, I've written wiki pages, and for the last few years, acted as an administrator in the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development]] project.

Lately, I've been increasingly busy with my university studies in Business Law. Unfortunately (or some might say: fortunately) this has made me somewhat less active at the forums. Despite this, I still hold an interest, will continue to run and develop my services, and will respond to direct queries. I should have more time for OpenTTD again starting March 2012, and more still, in Summer 2102.

I can be best reached by sending a private message at tt-forums - this buzzes my phone so I'm sure to take note.
