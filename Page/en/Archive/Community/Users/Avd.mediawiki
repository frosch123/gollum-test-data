Hello, this should be my page :)

=== Currently working projects ===

* Dutch wiki translation (improve it by [[nl/Main Page|reading]] it!)
* [[en/Community/Essays/Avd's Line Management|Better routes]]
* A web interface to configure an openttd server: [https://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/webottd webottd] (currently under full development)

=== Contact me ===

Leave a note in the discussion session or leave a note on [[en/Development/IRC channel]] (I'm usually hanging on the channels #openttd and if I'm not online, I will catch you later ;-))

Note that my nick is avdg and not avd. The change in my nick happened when all accounts had to switch on a centralised account, I really can not remember what happened there.
