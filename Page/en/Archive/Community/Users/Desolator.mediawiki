I am Mircea Chirea, a guy living in Craiova, Romania. I eat, sleep, breathe, talk and other stuff. I know a lot of xHTML, CSS, and the LUA based language in AutoPlay Media Studio. I'm currently working on a Romanian set for (O)TTD(P).

I use a lot GRF sets, and I love [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]'s [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] and [[en/Community/NewGRF/Aviators Aircraft Set]] sets. Don't ask for my openttd.cfg file or you'll die.
