'''TTD Profile''': I've been playing TTD for at least 5 years, on and off. I am no expert and am slowly learning by the users here. :) I use TTDPatch and OpenTTD. Both have pluses and minuses, but I like OpenTTD because it is a standalone game.  I hope to someday give back to the community with some graphics work.  I'm not a trains fanatic, but I sure do love miniatures and TTD gives me the opportunity to watch cute little pixel graphics move around. :)
