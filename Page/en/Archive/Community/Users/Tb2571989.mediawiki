Hi. I'm tb2571989, real name Tom. <br> {{en/Archive/Community/Users/Userbox Heightmap Artist}}I'm mainly responsible for the [[en/Archive/Manual/Troubleshooting Windows|Windows Troubleshooting Section]], it's the article I've spent most time on. I try to help people on the forums, and now I can help here too. I have no experience with OTTD on any other OS's, so please dont ask for help with non-windows problems. <br> <br>
I dont know why the wiki capatalises the 'T' in my username, it's quite annoying for me. 
I'm also a [[en/Manual/Heightmap]] artist, so if you want a heightmap, contact me using the links below.
