== Who Am I? ==
I'm a java/c++ developer from Sweden who has spent quite some time teaching software engineering in addition to working with it myself.

== What Brought me to OpenTTD? ==
I started playing OTTD with some friends around 2004 or maybe 2005. Sometime later I got an idea for a signal mod and started coding a bit. Then the OS X port slipped out of maintenance and since I needed it to run on my mac I decided to get it running again...

== OpenTTD work ==
* The yellow signals mod
* Removed the OS X dependency to SDL and made it use native graphics instead
* Some work on the tfc_newmap branch
* Played around a bit with 32bit graphics and additional zoom levels
