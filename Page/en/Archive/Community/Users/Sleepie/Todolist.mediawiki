Just some reminders to myself...

* Cleanup the Scenario Listings
:: Fix broken links, check all categories for missing or wrong placed scenarios etc.

* Add detail page, information for the toggle button

* Rework the page(s) for the configuration file
:: Think about templates for each setting
:: Reduce sub pages to a minimum, maybe the best option would be to organize it like the ingame settings dialogs and very few sub pages for the config file only settings
:: Check whether settings are still missing or obsolete against current trunk code or latest release branch
:: Before changing the current site, make a draft first to get some feedback :)
