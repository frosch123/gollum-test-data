'''Long Term Transport Tycoon Player'''

I first got ''Transport Tycoon'' when it cost Â£30 and was in a lovely full size box from the shops. I still have the original manual from the game. I am very pleased that today OpenTTD has brought Transport Tycoon back to life.


When I first saw the multiplayer aspect I was thrilled, as the not so good multiplayer part of the original game was my biggest disappointment. 

Recently I have had trouble concentrating on really good multiplayer games. Mostly because it's too easy to [[en/Community/Multiplayer cheating|cheating]] in the game, and I find myself just doing that instead. In an effort to encourage safer practices in the way people use OpenTTD I contributed a [[en/Community/Multiplayer cheating|cheating]] article which I hope will help people not be so vulnerable. OpenTTD has fairly good controls within it today, but they are not always used.
