Hi!! My name is Bruno Faria and i'm from Portugal, Torres Novas city..


I have 23 years old and i'm a big addicted of Transport Tycoon or on other words TT..


I've started playing TT in 1994 and then 2 years later i started playing TTD for more 2 years( Deluxe version )..


Then i made a break in TT World for some years, making my return in 2003 with patch.. 


Then after some months, OpenTTD appeared, and i loved the project.. So i started playing openttd in 2004 and never looked back..


I own a small company where i support small and medium companies, and give them network support.. 


I am MCSE - Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer and CCNA - Cisco Certified Network Professional


I love to keep updated where new features appear in OpenTTD, so you will see me update Roadmap quite a lot :)
