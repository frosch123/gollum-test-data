Hi out there,

my name is Clemi, I am from Germany and I loved Transport Tycoon from its release in 1994.

Now I'm a huge fan of OpenTTD and would love to contribute to the project. Translating parts of the wiki would be great, but there's no multilanguage support here. I hope this will change soon!
