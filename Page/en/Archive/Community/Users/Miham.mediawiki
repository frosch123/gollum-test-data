=Mihamix - OpenTTD Developer=

== Who Am I ==
My name is Attila BÃ¡n (which is pretty much the same, as Miham Kerekes), I am one of those guys, who joined the project at around 2004. My main task is to organize the translators and manage the translations, though [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Bjarni]] does this job on the tt-forums, I wrote a [http://translator2.openttd.org/ WebTranslator2], which is now widely used amongst translators, since it became the official way of translating OpenTTD.

My other tasks are hosting these services: [http://wiki.openttd.org/ wiki], [http://nightly.openttd.org/ nightlies], [http://docs.openttd.org/ docs], [http://translator2.openttd.org WT2].

=== Patches made ===
My patches to OpenTTD (not counting translations which got committed under my account) are the hungarian townnames patch, which is quite successful amongst hungarian players (at least I think this because of that countless positive user feedbacks :-); and the setting raw-material producing industry production values cheat.

Translations usually get committed daily...
