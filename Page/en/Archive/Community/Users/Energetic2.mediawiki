Longtime TTD/TTDX/TTDPatch/OpenTTD player. Big fan of goalservers. 
Why, you ask?
* Goalservers add a purpose to the game
* Money is actually something to consider, as you are competing with others
* Circling the map, huge terraforming and other trolling is quickly discouraged
* Town goal servers actually motivates players to use all possibilities of OpenTTD: air, truck, bus, water & rail all have a distinct way (and need) to apply them.
