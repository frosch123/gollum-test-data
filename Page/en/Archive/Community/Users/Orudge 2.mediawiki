Hello, I'm Owen, and this is my OpenTTD wiki account. If you want to know more about me, have a look at [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Orudge|my wiki entry]].

You can find me on IRC on QuakeNet ([irc://irc.quakenet.org/tycoon #tycoon]) and OFTC ([irc://irc.freenode.org/OpenTTD #OpenTTD]) as '''orudge''' if you want to say hello. Other contact details are on [http://www.owenrudge.net/contact my web site].
