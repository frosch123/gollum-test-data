Rought sketch of ideas for a future OpenTTD 2.0

== goal / script framework: definiable via *some* interface ==
* events:
** trigger action on certain conditions (date, town sizes, <item> becoming available,...)
*** build / destruct <item> (town, industry, landscaping, objects, roads, canals, rivers)
*** declare goal reached (see further down)
*** start new / close company
*** modify money
** goals definable by
*** <best value> reached at a certain date
*** <something> reached (first)
** goals:
*** money
*** cargo transported (different ones / amount one / all) FS#4706
*** towns or industries serviced
*** town or global population (town 'ownership' by most cargo units transported there?)
*** number of profitable vehicles (or other conditions on vehicles)
*** advanced: custom-scripted? Using / extending existing interface (admin port, NoAI API, NewGRF interface?)
* For goals with a numerical target: Graphs showing progress
** Company color, similar to company value graph
* News posts
** On town claiming / claimant switch
** On goal achieved
** On goal failed
* Display town ownership in town interface / map / minimap / town directory
* Possibility to freeze play after goal reached / failed.

== scenarios reworked ==
* allow definition independent of NewGRFs:
** keep town position and size (maybe also house category)
** keep industry positions and type
** keep roads, rivers, canals
** keep heightmap
* suggested NewGRFs (by grfID, update to latest version automatically)
== scenario editor reworked ==
* allow using it in multiplayer
* allow (re)configuration of NewGRFs and re-generate items (towns, industries) as necessary (see scenarios reworked)
* allow to change climate without using a cheat
* advanced: allow to change map size?
* allow to import savegames without fuzz
** allow to change NewGRFs as defined by scenarios reworked

== GUI:==
* font and font size selection
* GUI scale setting (normal, zoom*X (x=1,2,3,4 like currently zoom settings)
** possibly use something like http://scale2x.sourceforge.net/index.html
* allow NewGRFs (and base sets) to define sprites also for other zoom levels than 1 explicitly
* enable / disable 32bpp directly from GUI, similar to NewGRFs / base sets, integrate them in bananas
* grids yes/no
* rework main menu(s):
** title menu
*** new game
****  AI settings
**** NewGRF settings
**** Adv. Settings with difficulty(?) presets
**** Map settings
*** Join Network game
*** Scenario editor
*** High scores
*** GUI Settings
**** base sets
**** font
**** size / scale
**** language
**** ... (from adv. settings / GUI)
*** Online updates
**** game itself
**** content download
*** Quit

== Vehicle management: ==
* allow share and manage orders / colour / name / ... via groups
* vehicle templates(?) for building and replacement
* unify autorenew and autoreplace. It's confusing to have both (maybe make autorenew just the default for replacement rules)

== Cargo destinations ==
* cargos which want to go *somewhere* specific (either distribution or destinations)

== NewGRF-support for all kind of stations ==
* road stations and sea ports with state machines
* NewGRF capability for sea ports and road stations

== Terrain ==
* advanced map access / transparency, which enables also sub-ways
* more heighlevels and also sea levels (sub-sea-surface future buildings anyone?)
* map generation:
** generation of rivers
** placement of NewObjects?
