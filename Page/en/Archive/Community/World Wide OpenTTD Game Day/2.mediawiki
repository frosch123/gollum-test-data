1 = needed, 2 = nice to have, 3 = would be included if available

to be decided:
* will join-as-spectator be needed? --> handled by dih's new join & automove patch
* will no-tf (with rcon option yes/no on per-company basis) be needed? --> yes. It's a patch option anyway
* will no changes on company name, colour and manager name be needed? -> yes, It's a patch option on a per-company basis

==Teams==
 Playercounter: '''18'''

Note: There's no special company as every company can use the infrastructure of any other - unlike the last time! So "Global Warming Inc." is by no means special - only in the respect that its HQ is in the centre of the map.

==Gamesettings==
This things are still in discussion, if you like to participate, please use [[en/World Wide OpenTTD Game Day/2]] or join us on IRC: [irc://irc.oftc.net/#wwottdgd #WWOTTDGD] channel or [irc://irc.oftc.net/#openttdcoop.dev #openttdcoop.dev] channel .

LA was so kind to provide a map based on an idea by Mark. The scenario proposed is that 6 regional companies cater for their region with one secondary industry each (2x factories, 2x saw mill, 2x refinery). The central island is run by a global company. Products can be hauled from anywhere to your factory/saw mill/refinery in co-operation with the owners of the other sectors.

We have decided that in central island there will be
# Hub and transfer station
# Only goods will be delivered to the central station
# Goods will be delivered by regional company to central station.
<!--
To be decided what to do with the central island in detail:
# only hub on island?
# only transfer station on island?
## will all products be transferred via this station?
# hub and transfer station on island?
## will only be goods be transferred via this station?
### will goods be distributed by global company?
### will goods be distributed by regional companies?
# 8th company = PAX company?: two transfers from islands 1-3 to 4-6?
-->

==Map==
Rumor has it that LA is working on a nice map. - [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php?title=World_Wide_OpenTTD_Game_Day/map_progress Map progress]

[[File:en/Map LA.png|thumb|A teaser somewhat confirming the rumor :)]]
[http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=91825 Symbolic map]

[http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=91885 Height map]

Scenario is quite complete. Only some eyecandy to add hopefully. The map itself will be published after the event.

===TODO===

* The drop industries in the regions should be more inside the regions, not so much close the central region
* Breakdowns should be off (#openttdcoop standard) (easy, it's feasable via rcon)
* "Build in pause" cheat/setting should be off
* 90deg turns should be disallowed (#openttdcoop standard) (easy, it's feasable via rcon)
* Only 7 Companies (6+1), not 8
* Maybe no land between regions (in some places maybe rivers?)

==Additional Admin Features==
There are a range of features, which help especially the administration:
* clients are joined into the company they've been in last time.
* The usual multiplayer save patch settings with a graphical representation can be accessed via the (patch) settings dialogue. As admin put the rcon password into your openttd.cfg
* There is a range of additional rcon commands:
**
** allow_terraform = {bitmask per company: 1=enable, 0=disable; default: disable}. disallows terraforming completely on a per company basis
** allow_company_changes = {bitmask per company: 1=enable, 0=disable; default: disable}. disallows changes to the company and manager name as well as the company colour on a per company basis
** one_tile_terraform = {0|1}: restrics terraforming to two edges of a single tile, if enabled
** a range of rcon commands concerning the sharing patch. They're more easily available via GUI in the patch settings in a seperate section.
* move clients: open the client list, click on the client and choose move. A menue with available companies + spectator will show up. Click on your choice
* mute clients: open the client list, click on the client and choose mute. Choose mute all, mute team or mute private in order to shut up that client. It cannot talk unless unmuted. Don't use it on eachother, we could mute ourselfs mutually.
