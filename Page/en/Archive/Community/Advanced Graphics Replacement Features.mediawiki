== Vehicles ==
The aim of the OpenGFX+ vehicles is to make the original vehicles look better and be more useable; key aims are:
Code:
* Full stand-alone coding of the vehicles
:: This will allow use of the original trains/trucks/etc. with other vehicle sets
* Introduce cargo class refitting of the vehicles for newCargo support
* Parameter-controlled climate availability of vehicles (ie. trains)
Graphics:
* Tenders for steam engines
* 2 company colour graphics for all vehicles
* Livery overrides for non-steam trains (passenger, mail (and valuables?) carriages only)
* More loading stages (for eg. hopper and flatbed-type vehicles)
* New loading stage graphics (for eg. box and mail-type vehicles)

Other potential features would be additional vehicles in the OpenGFX style, particularly trams.
