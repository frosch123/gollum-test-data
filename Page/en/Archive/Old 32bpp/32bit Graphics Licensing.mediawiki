===Ben Robbins===

<blockquote>
I'm stating now that all sprites which I  have posted here (tt-forum) as a .tar  file are GPLv2. Preview images and .rar's, unless I have otherwise stated, are just for previews, and are here to gather opinions, but are not publicly released, and not for cutting up/reassembling. Any files which I post onto Jupix's file repository or the wiki are GPLv2 likewise.

I have decide to release the blendfiles I made for openttd.
I have chosen to release them under the creative commons attribution share alike licence, but if and when Openttd requires it I will rerelease the files under a different licence (i.e. GPL).

===GeekToo===

<blockquote>
I release any tars or png files I've uploaded in this forum or on Jupix repository up til this moment under the GPL-2 and GPL-3 licence. I grant permission to any user of this forum or OpenTTD developer to redistribute them in a larger graphics pack or to modify them as needed. This includes also the toolbar tar, for which I have JoeD's permission to use the sprites he created.
One exception: the town houses that I created ([http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=722362#p722362 viewtopic.php?p=722362#p722362]) are a derivative work of DMH_Mac's work, maybe not recognizable as such. I do have his permission to modify and distribute that, but he released his work under the CC-BY-SA licence, so I'm bound to that for redistribution, and you'll have to contact him if you want to relicence it.

===j0rdax===

<blockquote>
The stuff I make for OpenTTD is free to be released and used in any kind of "pack" for OpenTTD. I have never stated that it is GPL, so this serves as the license for it to be used without sources.
</blockquote>{{en/Note|j0rdax hasn't released his graphics under GPL so they can never can be included in any official pack...yet}}

<blockquote>
Whatever stuff you find that is done by me and want to use it, be free to do so.. If gpl v2 was the best solution for you, then mine are released under that (unless stated otherwise at the posting itself, as I can't recall if I have released/posted anything with any licence at all (unlikely) ).
