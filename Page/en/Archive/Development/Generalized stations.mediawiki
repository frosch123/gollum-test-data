|-
|1||2||{{en/Ottdp|1.1|2.6|ottdrev=r20670|ttdprev=r2340}}||Irremovable<ref>Object cannot be removed through normal dynamite, control must be held and the removal cost will be multiplied by 25 (this is the usual behaviour for most class A objects in TTDPatch).</ref>
|-
|2||4||{{en/Ottdp|1.1|2.6|ottdrev=r20670|ttdprev=r2340}}||Anything Can Remove (owned land behaviour)

Like stations you must enable animation on a per tile basis by means of the "built tile" trigger and callback 159.</ref>
