Okay, lets see some code.

  struct tile {
    uint type; // Bridge, ground, support, tunnel, etc.
    union {
      struct bridge {
        uint bridgetype; // not sure this is needed
      };
      struct ground {
        uint slope;
        uint grass_state;
      };
      struct support {
        // What should go here?
      };
      struct tunnel {
        //maybe we should have information about the direction here?
      };
    };
  };
  
  struct content {
    uint type; // station, industry, rail, road, etc.
    union {
      struct station {
      };
      struct industry {
      };
      struct rail {
      };
      // etc
    }
  }
    
  struct maptile {
    uint height; // z coordinate
    struct tile tile;
    struct content content;
    maptile* next;
  } _map[];
