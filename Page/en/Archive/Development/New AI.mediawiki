{{en/Warning|The New AI in OpenTTD is DEAD. It is no longer on active development. If you want to pick it up again, feel free and have a look at [[en/Development/Script/Main Page]]. Note, however, that NoAI branch is active, and is developing new OpenTTD AIs using Squirrel.}}


This information pertains to work done on the now-deprecated 'New AI', which has largely been replaced by '[[en/Development/Script/Main Page]]' for the purpose of ongoing development. 

New AI plans:

- [[en/New AI/Airport]] Airport

- [[en/New AI/Trains]] Trains .... what about trains?
