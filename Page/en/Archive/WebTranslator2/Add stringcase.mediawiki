Simply follow these steps:
# Initial situation <center>[[File:en/Archive/WebTranslator2/Add-case-step-1.png|center|frame|1. - Initial state of the string to be expanded]]</center>
# After clicked on the button shown above <center>[[File:en/Archive/WebTranslator2/Add-case-step-2.png|center|frame|2. - The new and uninitialised string-case]]</center>
# After filled in the fields <center>[[File:en/Archive/WebTranslator2/Add-case-step-3.png|center|frame|3. - Next step toward the change...]]</center>
# After going back -- where is my new string case?! <center>[[File:en/Archive/WebTranslator2/Add-case-step-4.png|center|frame|4. - Where did it disappeared?!]]</center>
# It didn't disappeared, just not shown until it's get committed to the SVN <center>[[File:en/Archive/WebTranslator2/Add-case-step-5.png|center|frame|5. - Final suggestions, troubleshooting guide, etc...]]</center>

Well, it could be argued upon whether the current behaviour is good or not, I'm accepting critics :-)
