==General Fixes==

* 2006-02-01 r3508-r3509 - Remove deprecated -p parameter.
* 2006-02-06 r3560       - Fix plural forms of cargo types for several languages.
* 2006-02-06 r3565       - Fix GetPlayerRailtypes to include 365 day period of vehicle unavailability. Fixes a rare but possible network desync when the first vehicle of a railtype is introduced.
* 2006-02-07 r3570-r3571 - Drasticly reduce loading time for games with a large amount of trains with custom graphics. Sample savegame changed from 20 seconds loading to approx. 2 seconds.
* 2006-02-07 r3572       - Reduce run time of GetFreeUnitNumber() by building a cache of used/available unit numbers. The result is one loop of all vehicles instead of perhaps several hundred. Sample savegame changed from about 1 second to allocate a unit number to "unnoticable."
* 2006-02-24 r3670       - [OSX] Increased speed of the full screen drawing in the cocoa video driver by 1000% (a bug prevents this code from speeding up on Intel CPUs, so it's a PPC only thing... so far)

* 2006-03-16 r3877-r3908 - Bridge system fixes (by Tron)
