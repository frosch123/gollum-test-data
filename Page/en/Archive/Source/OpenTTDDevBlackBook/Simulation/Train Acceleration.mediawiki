This page tries to summarize the algorithm used for realistic train acceleration. What follows is a description of the formulas listed at the bottom of this page.


* acceleration = (force &ndash; friction) / 4''m''
** where ''m'' is the mass of the train

* force = 2.2 * power / velocity = 2.2 * time * power / distance

* friction = 4 * (1.3''m'' + 60''n'' + ''&mu;mv''*10<sup>-3</sup> + ''Adv''<sup>2</sup>/10,000 + ''q'')
** where ''n'' is the number of cars
** and ''v'' is the velocity.

* ''&mu;'' is the coefficient of friction, which is set to 35 for OpenTTD.

* ''A'' is the area of ''mumble, mumble'' 120.

* ''d'' = 20+3''n''
** This is the ''drag coefficient,'' although it does not depend on velocity as one would expect.

* ''q'' = &Sigma; 60''s<sub>i</sub>m<sub>i</sub>''
** where ''s<sub>i</sub>'' is the slope of car ''i''
** and ''m<sub>i</sub>'' is the mass of car ''i''.
: This is incline of the train as a whole (or the sum of the inclines of each car), where 60''s<sub>i</sub>m<sub>i</sub>'' is the incline of a single car ''i''.
* The slop of a car is one of the following:
** 1 if the car is ascending
** 0 if the car is level
** -1 if the car is descending




== Units used ==

velocity ''[v]'' = mph

power ''[P]'' = W

mass ''[m]'' = t

== Formulas ==

''F'' = 22''P'' / 10''v'' [N]

''n'' &mdash; number of cars

''&mu;'' = 35 (eq. 1e-3 ?) &mdash; coefficient of friction

''A'' = 120 &mdash; area (units?)

''d'' = 20+3''n'' &mdash; drag coefficient

''q'' = &Sigma; 60''s<sub>i</sub>m<sub>i</sub>'' &mdash; incline term, summed over cars

''s<sub>i</sub>'' &mdash; slope, -1 (going down), 0, or 1

''m<sub>i</sub>'' &mdash; mass of the car

''Fr'' = 4(13''m'' / 10 + 60''n'' + ''&mu;mv'' / 1000 + ''Adv''<sup>2</sup>/10000 + q) [N]

''a'' = (''F'' - ''Fr'') / (''m'' * 4) [m s<sup>-2</sup>]
