This document explains how to add variables to the console.

==the first step==
the first thing you ll need if you want to do anything within the console is
<pre>
include "console.h"
</pre>
this gives you the ability to access all IConsole functions and structures you will have to use if you are intending to add Commands/Functions/Variables to the Console.

==adding a c++ variable==
to add an c++ variable to the console variable list you only need to put this somewhere in your sourcecode where it is executed during the openttd initialization process:
<pre>
IConsoleVarRegister("myvar",(void *) &my_static_var,ICONSOLE_VAR_BYTE);
</pre>
ICONSOLE_VAR_BYTE can be replaced with another variable type according to your c++ variable definition.

==adding a virtual c++ variable==
this is as easy as the procedure for adding an c++ variable.
<pre>
_iconsole_var * var;
var = IConsoleVarAlloc(ICONSOLE_VAR_BOOLEAN);
IConsoleVarInsert(var,"temp_bool");
var = IConsoleVarAlloc(ICONSOLE_VAR_INT16);
IConsoleVarInsert(var,"temp_int16");
</pre>
this adds two virtual variables.. virtual variables arent mapped to an c++ variable so they were only accessable over the console or from within c++ over
<pre>
_iconsole_var * IConsoleVarGet(byte * name);
</pre>
this allows the usage of instance based strings in c++. for a description of instance based strings read [[en/Archive/Source/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/IConsole/Scripting|Using Console Scripting]]
