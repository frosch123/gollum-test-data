==Changelog==
===1.3.1 (2013-06-01)===

* Fix: When overbuilding a reserved track with a non-track station tile, that tile would remain reserved and eventually trigger a crash upon removal {{en/Flyspray|5540}} (r25251)

===1.3.1-RC1 (2013-05-17)===

* Change: [Win32] MSVC 2010 comes with stdint.h (r25128)

* Fix: [NewGRF] Revise when vehicle running sound effects 04, 07 and 08 are played; in depot or tunnel, or when crashed or stopped: No sound. Braking: Effect 08 instead of 07 {{en/Flyspray|5538}} (r25226)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Play vehicle sound effect also for planes (r25225)
* Fix: [NewGRF] cur_speed is only valid for the front engine, so make other engines in the consist use the speed of the front {{en/Flyspray|5534}} (r25224)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Make tick_counters work the same for vehicles (r25223, r25222)

* Fix: Consider map border as water with repsect to river/canal continuation (r25220)
* Fix: [Script] Clarify on which tiles IsDesertTile and IsSnowTile work, i.e. the ones without infrastructure or buildings, and introduce GetTerrainType for the cases where IsDesertTile/IsSnowTile do not work {{en/Flyspray|5537}} (r25213)
* Fix: The level crossing sound is an ambient sound and not a new year sound (r25200)
* Fix: Original train and road vehicle acceleration did no longer respect bridge speed limits {{en/Flyspray|5523}} (r25167)
