===0.6.3 (2008-10-01)===

* Fix: NewGRF VarAction 2 variable 43 for industries saw MP_VOID tiles as land tiles and was inefficient (r14417, r14416, r14415)
* Fix: Possible buffer overrun/wrong parameter type passed to printf (r14414, r14397)
* Fix: Generation seed set using -G was always overwritten by -g (r14408)
* Fix: Do not allow extending signals by dragging in any direction other than the track direction {{en/Flyspray|2202}} (r14013)

* Fix: Invalid v->u.air.targetairport could cause crashes at several places {{en/Flyspray|2300}} (r14383, r14344, r14343)
* Fix: Moving the first vehicle of a train elsewhere might require a new unitnumber for the remaining chain which might not be available (r14384) 
* Fix: Trams jumping when reversing on a single trambit (like caused during road construction reworks) or when (manually) reversing in a corner {{en/Flyspray|1852}} (r14371) 
* Fix: Multiheaded parts in free wagon chains weren't connected (could cause desyncs) (r14366, r14362) 
* Fix: [Win32] Some keypress combinations could be handled twice {{en/Flyspray|2206}} (r14363) 
* Fix: The ownership of roadtiles was not properly set for very old savegames (including TTD's) making it impossible to remove some pieces of road {{en/Flyspray|2311}} (r14359) 
* Fix: Desync due to randomly ordered vehicle hash by flooding and road vehicle overtake/following (r14356, r14258) 
* Fix: Signs were not updated on company bankrupcy/sell, and thus could have the colour of invalid player (r14348) 
* Fix: Delete the RenameSignWindow when 'its' sign is deleted (r14345) 
* Fix: Signs from old savegames were lost (causing little memory leaks) (r14340) 
* Fix: When a company was renamed and then manager was renamed before building anything, company name changed (r14328) 
* Fix: When you rename a town before building something and build something near that town your company would be called "<old townname> Transport" {{en/Flyspray|2251}} (r14327) 
* Fix: Free any blocks that a helicopter may have on an oilrig when the helicopter gets forcefully removed (bankruptcy). For other airports this isn't needed as they can't be used by multiple companies {{en/Flyspray|2241}} (r14324) 
* Fix: Possible assert when renaming removed waypoint (r14322) 
* Fix: Properly delete orders so the pool doesn't fill up (r14319) 
* Fix: Do not allow building road over level crossings and drive-through road stops in the wrong direction; do not allow adding roadtypes to non-drive through road stops; pay for all added road bits {{en/Flyspray|2268}} (r14316, r14315, r14314, r14308) 
* Fix: Aircraft frozen above oil rig when the next order is invalid {{en/Flyspray|2244}} (r14309)

* Fix: One could be trying to get the station name of a station that is outside of the pool (r14297) 
* Fix: Default for sound effects and music volume should be in the valid range for that setting {{en/Flyspray|2286}} (r14289) 
* Fix: Make small UFO aware of articulated RVs so they crash the complete vehicle instead of a small part of it (r14270) 
* Fix: Desyncs after deleting a waypoint because of explicit destructor call instead of using operator delete (r14265) 
* Fix: Merge keycode for "normal" 0-9 keys and keypad 0-9 keys so people do not get confused that the keypad does not work as expected {{en/Flyspray|2277}} (r14260) 
* Fix: Clicking on the smallmap didn't break the "follow vehicle in main viewport" {{en/Flyspray|2269}} (r14243) 
* Fix: The engine-purchase-list-sorter doubled running-cost and halfed capacity of double-headed engines {{en/Flyspray|2267}} (r14239) 
* Fix: Feeder share was computed wrong when splitting cargo packet (r14234) 
* Fix: Signs (town name, station name, ...) could be too long for 8bit width in pixels (r14221)

* Fix: When determining length of a string with limited size, first check if we are not out of bounds already (r14204) 
* Fix: Properly update the current timetable's travel/wait times instead of only doing it for one vehicle in the shared order chain and only when some bit has not been set {{en/Flyspray|2236}} (r14192) 
* Fix: Sprite payload skipping would not skip enough bytes in a very small subset of compressed sprites (r14191) 
* Fix: After applying NewGRF settings, all rail and road types were available as the engine availability check was performed too early (r14182) 
* Fix: Close all related vehicle lists when closing a station window (and not only the train list) (r14180) 
* Fix: RemoveOrderFromAllVehicles() did not mark enough windows dirty (r14179) 
* Fix: Incorrect cargo weights (r14144) 
* Fix: GetSlopeZ() gets a virtual coordinate, not a tile (r14139) 
* Fix: Close the 'manage vehicles' dropdown once the number of vehicles in the list reaches 0 {{en/Flyspray|2249}} (r14133) 
* Fix: [strgen] Changing order of parameters {X:...} did not work for strings including some {StringY} (r14111) 
* Fix: Desync due to bubbles in toyland (r14110) 
* Fix: Make NewGRF action 0x06's changes persistent over the several loading stages {{en/Flyspray|1986}} (r14102) 
* Fix: Make the 'Transfer Credit' display aware of the entire consist, not only the first vehicle (r14098)

* Fix: The vehicle window of articulated road vehicles would show the clone/refit button when the vehicle was not completely stopped in the depot (r14090) 
* Fix: Flawed parsing of words (as in 2 bytes) in GRF strings due to sign extension {{en/Flyspray|2228}} (r14087) 
* Fix: Division by 0 in NewAI {{en/Flyspray|2226}} (r14062) 
* Fix: NewGRF callback 23 did not use the NewGRF compatible text stack {{en/Flyspray|2224}} (r14058) 
* Fix: NewGRF text stack's "push word" didn't move the data around properly (r14057) 
* Fix: Long strings in the edit box would cause OpenTTD to stop drawing the string. This is especially noticable with low resolutions and the chat input box (r14054) 
* Fix: [OSX] changed the condition for selecting 8 or 32 bpp blitter by default. Now we will pick 32 bpp if no 8 bpp fullscreen resolutions are available on the main display (the one with the dock) (r14032) 
* Fix: Crash when the AI tries to find the depot of an airport that doesn't have a depot {{en/Flyspray|2190}} (r13999) 
* Fix: MSVC cannot handle changed files in the prebuild event, so make the version determination a separate subproject {{en/Flyspray|2004}} (r13998) 
* Fix: The dedicated console removed any character that was not a printable ASCII character instead. Now it allows UTF8 formated strings too {{en/Flyspray|2189}} (r13992) 
* Fix: Resetting construction stage counter reset more than it should (r13981) 
* Fix: Wrong tooltip for the industry directory's list {{en/Flyspray|2178}} (r13917)
