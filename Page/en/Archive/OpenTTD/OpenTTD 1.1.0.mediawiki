==Changelog==

===1.1.0 (2011-04-01)===
* Fix: In the scenario editor you could build a ship depot using the appropriate hotkey. Removing that depot causes an assertion to trigger {{en/Flyspray|4558}} (r22266)

===1.1.0-RC3 (2011-03-18)===

* Fix: New game settings were applied to early when starting a game via a heightmap. {{en/Flyspray|4557}} (r22259)
* Fix: Do not resort town, industry and signs list directly in OnInvalidateData(). There might be a scheduled rebuild which needs execution first. So, only set a trigger for resorting {{en/Flyspray|4546}} (r22249, r22248, r22247, r22246, r22245, r22244, r22243, r22242, r22241, r22236, r22228, r22227, r22226)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Object variable 0x48 was not available in callback 0x15C (r22231)
* Fix: Compilation when compiling with --disable-ai (r22222)
* Fix: When downloading a file via HTTP failed mid-way and OpenTTD fell back to the old system the partial downloaded amount would be counted twice {{en/Flyspray|4543}} (r22208)
* Fix: The 'center' (for movement) of vehicles is (currently still) always at 4/8th original vehicle length from the front, so trains should stop at the same location regardless of the length of the front engine {{en/Flyspray|4545}} (r22206)
* Fix: Make the base costs for building and demolishing NewObjects also local to the individual NewGRFs (r22204)
* Fix: Removing a station order could stop when removing first automatic order (r22200)
* Fix: Invalidate the object build window when using the date cheat (r22193)

===1.1.0-RC2 (2011-03-04)===

* Fix: Following a vehicle with a very high VehicleID was impossible (r22181)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Memory leak if an industry NewGRF had more than one prop A or 15, or a station NewGRF had more than one prop 09 (r22175, r22165)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a station NewGRF when it contains an unterminated spritelayout in action0 prop 08 instead of crashing (r22164)
* Fix: Building a station part adjacent to both an existing station and a rail waypoint failed {{en/Flyspray|4541}} (r22163)
* Fix: No update of NewGRF window when unknown GRF name becomes available {{en/Flyspray|4533}} (r22162)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Industry prop 0x11 is 4-bytes long, not 3 bytes (r22157)
* Fix: Stations/infrastructure were not properly sold on some clients during bankruptcy {{en/Flyspray|4529}} (r22154)
* Fix: The Greek translation did not work as it breached the 200.000 bytes 'limit' for loading language files {{en/Flyspray|4536}} (r22153)
* Fix: Windows video driver crashed when it could not go to full screen at the resolution of the configuration file when starting OpenTTD {{en/Flyspray|4521}} (r22149)
* Fix: Do not run savegame conversion during SlNullPointers; the pointer might not be converted or be NULL at that point (r22146)
* Fix: Some valid keycodes were ignored along with the invalid ones (r22142)
* Fix: When commands need to invalidate windows, process these events asynchronously before the next redraw. Calling window code directly from command scope uses wrong _current_company and might issue nested DoCommands() which interfer with the running command {{en/Flyspray|4523}} (r22141, r22140, r22135, r22134)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Skipping only the invalid part of an action14 failed, the rest of the action was skipped instead (r22138)
* Fix: Spectators had crashes when closing buoy windows (r22131)
* Fix: Build-station-window showed wrong selection when reopening {{en/Flyspray|4530}} (r22128)
* Fix: Canals would get drawn as land in the smallmap when using the owner window (r22127)
* Fix: The animation-ness of two goldmine tiles were swapped, causing the wheeltower to not work properly, and the bottom corner to show the wrong sprite {{en/Flyspray|4528}} (r22125)
* Fix: CommandQueue::Pop() did not update 'last'; popping the last item caused the queue to disconnect unless there was only one item {{en/Flyspray|4522}} (r22123)
* Fix: When a NOT_REACHED in saveload can be reached due to an invalid savegame, use SlErrorCorrupt instead. In other words, do not crash but show an error message (r22122)
* Fix: In case of high frame_freq one could get commands executed after a new network game was started (r22121)
* Fix: [NoAI] Prevent AIs from getting consistently over their allowed amount of operations by subtracting the amount they went over 'budget' from the budget for the next 'tick' (r22120)
* Fix: The refit window was not correctly updated after selecting with Ctrl+Click {{en/Flyspray|4525}} (r22118)

* Feature: Wheel scrolling in the console (r21982)
* Feature: Console command to reset the engine pool. It removes the traces of engines which are no longer associated to a NewGRF, and can be used to e.g. 'fix' scenarios which were screwed up by the author. You can only use it when there are no vehicles in the game though (r21975)
* Feature: Add a setting to enable/disable funding local road reconstruction (r21974)
* Feature: Introduce 'minimal' number of industries as a replacment for the old 'none' setting in the new game window (r21969)
* Change: When loading old savegames with long trains set the maximum train length to the length of the longest train (r22061)
* Change: Always report mammoth trains are disabled to NewGRFs, and allow the maximum train length to be modified in multiplayer as well {{en/Flyspray|4471}} (r22004)
* Fix: Remove invalid keycodes when reading hotkeys.cfg {{en/Flyspray|4510}} (r22094)
* Fix: The server list did not get sorted with one item in it, so the 'position in the list' variable was never updated causing problems when using the keyboard shortcuts for scrolling {{en/Flyspray|4514}} (r22093)
* Fix: When deleting towns, only relocate objects during DC_EXEC (r22087)
* Fix: [Windows] If fullscreen fails with current resolution, use desktop resolution {{en/Flyspray|4489}} (r22081)
* Fix: The owner view of the smallmap was not updated after a company colour change (r22079)
* Fix: Maximum train length interfered with wagon replacement when wagon removal was turned on {{en/Flyspray|4499}} (r22078)
* Fix: NewGRFs with invalid multi-tile houses could cause a valid 1x1 house following it to be seen as multi-tile, causing crashes {{en/Flyspray|4501}} (r22075)
* Fix: Immediately update the train weight when you change the multiplier for train cargo weight (r22073)
* Fix: Some hotkey names in hotkey.cfg for the scenario editor toolbar were completely bogus (r22071)
* Fix: Crashes when disconnecting after requesting the map {{en/Flyspray|4503}} (r22070)
* Fix: Delete all savegame packets, not just the first one (r22069)
* Fix: Return 'connection lost' instead of 'okay' when SendPackets closed the connection, so we do not try to do anything else with the closed socket (r22068)
* Fix: Do not hold a mutex when sending packets and thus possibly closing the connection as that wants to acquire the mutex again (r22067)
* Fix: Verify we can allocate an Order, OrderList, CargoPacket, CargoPayment, and others before we actually try to do so (all corner cases) {{en/Flyspray|4468}} (r22066, r22057, r22047, r22042, r22040, r22033, r22031, r22026, r22025, r22024, r22023, r22022)
* Fix: Crash when disconnecting and reconnecting while the server is still saving the savegame {{en/Flyspray|4497}} (r22064)
* Fix: Memory leak when saving with LZMA or zlib fails mid-way (r22062)
* Fix: Make the send chat message window follow the position of the status bar (r22059)
* Fix: Metric and imperial HP are not the same. As imperial HP are used internally, set a conversion rate for metric HP {{en/Flyspray|4408}} (r22056)
* Fix: [Squirrel] Some invalid squirrel code caused the squirrel compiler to crash {{en/Flyspray|4490}} (r22055)
* Fix: The land area information window was not updated after a language change (r22053)
* Fix: Roads under road stops would get a wrong owner after overbuilding (r22051)
* Fix: In ancient savegames, e.g. TTO savegames, non primary vehicles (wagons and such) could have unitnumbers or even orders. However, these orders would not be updated when a station is removed. As such some savegames have wagons with current orders to invalid stations which triggers trouble in the load conversion. So, trash any orders/unitnumbers a non-primary vehicle has {{en/Flyspray|4496}} (r22050)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Company 0 does not always exist, so put temporary vehicles in a valid company (r22048)

* Fix: Tab completion in chat did not cycle through all possible options (r22038)
* Fix: Crash when watching the vehicle view of a vehicle that has multiple sequential nearest depot orders (or consists of a single nearest depot order) when there is no depot with index 0 {{en/Flyspray|4488}} (r22034)
* Fix: The server list got not resorted/redrawn after NewGRFs were downloaded {{en/Flyspray|4482}} (r22029)
* Fix: When paused and having the allowed actions while paused setting on 'no actions' cheating money would fail {{en/Flyspray|4479}} (r22016)
* Fix: Only show one AI per unique ID instead of all versions in the output of 'openttd -h' (r22007)
* Fix: Smoke/sparks of trains would be shown under bridges, or rather through bridges {{en/Flyspray|4480}} (r22006)
* Fix: When the difference between force and resistance is smaller than the mass(*4) there would be no acceleration anymore, even when at higher (or lower) speed the force and resistance balance out better {{en/Flyspray|4473}} (r21997)
* Fix: [YAPF] Under some circumstances vehicles could be lost {{en/Flyspray|4472}} (r21996)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Make computations of closest-land/water-distances handle waterish tiles more correctly (r21994)
* Fix: When building a lock on dry land costs for clearing water were deducted rather than for building canals (r21993)
* Fix: AIs trying to change the AIOF_GOTO_NEAREST_DEPOT flag for existing orders triggered an assert. Explicitly forbid this as precondition for SetOrderFlags {{en/Flyspray|4467}} (r21992)
* Fix: The share/copy-orders-cursor was not updated to refer to the new vehicle when it got autoreplaced/-renewed {{en/Flyspray|4466}} (r21991)
* Fix: Vehicle status bar glitches on speed changes (r21989)
* Fix: Scrolling of the console in pages used wrong line height and scrolled too much (r21979)
* Fix: Redraw the town authority window after modifying town authority settings (r21973)
* Fix: Crash when a multiplayer company goes bankrupt with 'you' in it {{en/Flyspray|4464}} (r21970)

* Feature: GUI setting to disable reversing at signals (r21962)
* Feature: Not loading and not unloading is now possible (r21961)
* Change: [NewGRF] Disable the flipping of train engines/wagons in the depot by default for NewGRFs {{en/Flyspray|4462}} (r21966)
* Change: Show the length of vehicles in tiles, instead of half tiles in the depot (r21960)
* Change: Replace longbridges settings with custom maximum bridge and tunnel length setting (r21959)
* Change: Randomize the vehicle a small UFO targets, do not use the one with lowest index (r21949)

* Fix: Crash when converting a savegame with vehicles crashed in a tunnel entry, or with vehicles reversing there (r21947)
* Fix: Funny behaviour when a road vehicle reverses while overtaking, so abort the overtake attempt when reversing the road vehicle {{en/Flyspray|4447}} (r21946)
* Fix: Not all vehicles should be tested to be inside a tunnel upon savegame load {{en/Flyspray|4460}} (r21940)
* Fix: Do not remove existing road/tram bits when overbuilding stops of the opposite road type {{en/Flyspray|4457}} (r21936)
* Fix: Allow to overbuild road stops which are built over trams (r21935)
* Fix: Automatic orders behave now stable wrt. service orders and are not added or removed depending on the need of servicing {{en/Flyspray|4440}} (r21933)
* Fix: The town window would not be invalidated in the scenario editor if the ground changed and thus the required cargos for town growth {{en/Flyspray|4554}} (r21929)
* Fix: Converting an expensive rail type to a cheap one could give more money than removing and rebuilding cost (r21919)
* Fix: Languages improperly sorted in the 'start server' window {{en/Flyspray|4443}} (r21918)
* Fix: the minimum speed needed for (realistic) acceleration to work properly can sometimes be more than the (temporary) maximum speed causing Clamp to 'fail'. Make sure that the minimum speed always overrules the maximum speed  {{en/Flyspray|4442}} (r21916)
* Fix: Include the capacity of non-refittable vehicles in the refitted-capacity, if their cargo matches (r21904)
* Fix: Do not count articulated parts when passing the number of vehicles to refit to the command. That may exceed 8 bits (r21902)
* Fix: [NoAI] Hide automatic orders from AIs as they have no way of dealing with them (r21900)
* Fix: Do not show a vehicle selection in the RefitWindow for refit orders. You cannot select anything anyway (r21899)
* Fix: Using a pointer-iterator and adding things (thus reallocating) to the iterated array caused OpenTTD to crash on invalid pointers {{en/Flyspray|4438}} (r21898)

* Fix: Crash when scrolling outside of the main window (with some video backends) {{en/Flyspray|4434}} (r21889)
* Fix: [NewGRF] String codes 0x80 and 0x81 were broken since the typechecking of string parameters {{en/Flyspray|4422}} (r21885)
* Fix: When a train after reversing ended at the last bit of a bridge ramp and directed outside the bridge, it could still have track set to TRACK_BIT_WORMHOLE (r21880)
* Fix: When a single-vehicle train was reversed while on a slope, its GOINGUP/DOWN were not swapped (r21874)
* Remove: Settings for vehicle speed in the vehicle view, long date in status bar, drawing of bridge pillars, support for depot orders, time tabling and joining of stations upon building (r21958, r21957, r21956, r21955, r21954)
* Remove: The non-uniform stations setting; it has been broken for over a year, and thus not used {{en/Flyspray|4456}} (r21953)

* Change: Allow LMB scrolling with the mouse outside of the extra viewport instead of canceling scrolling when going slightly over the edge (r21838)
* Change: Only show rail/road types that will eventually be available in-game. For example do not show trams when there is no tram NewGRF loaded (r21817)
* Change: Keep aqueducts and road/tram tunnels and bridges after removing a company (r21780)
* Fix: Distant-join station would build at the wrong location when having persistent building turned on and selecting a 'second' location for the station tile {{en/Flyspray|4430}} (r21864)

* Fix: Crash with the small map window on big endian platforms {{en/Flyspray|4417}} (r21830)
* Fix: The expectations from the 'always build infrastructure' setting name/description did not match the behaviour {{en/Flyspray|4007}} (r21826)
* Fix: Allow dragging of combo signals (again) {{en/Flyspray|4378}} (r21816)
* Fix: [YAPF] Apply a pathfinder penalty for back of one-way path signals so those arenot preferred over other possibilities {{en/Flyspray|3908}} (r21815)
* Fix: Check GRF version from action 8, and disallow usage of GRFs with versions above 7 (r21814)
* Fix: Crash when displaying the owner view {{en/Flyspray|4411}} (r21813)

* Change: Tune 'realistic' acceleration even more to make more trains reach their top speed, and make it behave more like TTDPatch (r21712)
* Change: Display the minimum height of the tile in the LandInfo window instead of the height of the northern corner. So it is more useful for NewGRF and AI developers, and maybe more transparent for players (r21711)
* Fix: The diagonal iterator would iterate twice over some tiles {{en/Flyspray|4395}} (r21747)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Canal variable 83 accessed water random bits also for non-water tiles (e.g. watery industries or objects) (r21746)

* Fix: A loading order was also marked as 'not part of orders' when the order before the current order was deleted (r21737)
* Fix: Admin bots were not always notified of password changes {{en/Flyspray|4377}} (r21727)
* Fix: Vehicle sprite was cached into a 16 bit variable, causing incorrect sprites to be displayed (r21709)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Report TTDPatch flag 4A (newobjects) as set (r21708)
* Fix: The old ship pathfinder is too stupid to provide 'lost' notices; it would even get lost while following its own path {{en/Flyspray|4370}} (r21706)

* Fix: Changing AI settings ingame was impossible when the difficulty level was other than custom (r21694)
* Fix: Due to an error in the Debian changelog building of Debian/Ubuntu packages failed (r21682)

===1.1.0-beta2 (2010-12-31)===

* Feature: Command logging using the admin interface (r21668)
* Feature: Concept of automatic station orders; add stub orders for intermediate stations and remove them when not visiting them anymore. This allows you to see what trains visit a station without actually having to order a vehicle to stop at all stations (r21642)
* Add: [NoAI] AIEventTownFounded (r21664)
* Add: [NoAI] AIRail::GetName() to get the name of a railtype (r21663)
* Add: [NoAI] AITown::IsCity() so AIs can find out which towns grow faster than others (r21654)
* Change: Do not show price to build a bridge in the scenario editor as they are free to build there {{en/Flyspray|4358}} (r21673)
* Change: Do not highlight tile when selecting a vehicle to clone or an order to skip to (r21616)
* Fix: Estonia introduced the Euro in 2011 (r21670)
* Fix: Autofill timetable had side effects in test mode, possibly causing desyncs in MP {{en/Flyspray|4354}} (r21660)
* Fix: Cargo payment graph was not properly invalidated when payment rate changed {{en/Flyspray|4351}} (r21658)
* Fix: Use a bool instead of uint8 to store a bool and use the dedicated accessor function when reading boolean settings {{en/Flyspray|4345}} (r21656)
* Fix: Infinite loop in the road pathfinder due to bouncing around in an 'one way' trap; two one ways pointing towards eachother making it impossible to leave {{en/Flyspray|4338}} (r21651)
* Fix: Make <nowiki>'[centre|main] view'</nowiki> consistent, and make <nowiki>'[main|global] view'</nowiki> consistent {{en/Flyspray|4339}} (r21650)
* Fix: Newly created skip-to order was created at wrong place (r21633)
* Fix: Ships with the old pathfinder would easily show up as lost, even when it would eventually find a path. Now also the distance from the 'end' of the pathfinding run to the destination is compared to the current distance to the destination; if the distance to the destination at the end of the pathfinder run is less than the current distance from the destination the ship will not be marked as lost. This means that the ships with the old pathfinder will less likely get marked as lost, but due to the design of the old ship pathfinder there 'lostness' is merely a best guess. When you still get a lost message you need to build buoys to guide the ship pathfinder {{en/Flyspray|4325}} (r21631)
* Fix: Version detection of subversion branches and tags got broken (r21630)
* Fix: Crash under certain circumstances when using autorail {{en/Flyspray|4327}} (r21619)

* Feature: Building while paused always works in the scenario editor {{en/Flyspray|1521}} (r21430)
* Feature: Perform the compression of savegames to send to the client asynchronously.

* Feature: A simple sprite alignment helper. It does not store the new offsets anywhere so as soon as the sprite is reloaded the offsets are gone (use a bigger sprite cache if this happens). Also anything that reloads NewGRFs (new games, loading games or (re)applying NewGRFs) clears the sprite cache and as such resets the offsets (r19723)

* Add: [NoAI] AIIndustry::GetIndustryID(TileIndex) (r19773)
* Change: Make it possible to start actions that require selecting stuff (landscaping, vehicle cloning, etc) in the viewport while paused. As side-effect you will get an error message explaining the command cannot be executed because the game is paused instead of seemingly nothing happening when you click. Additional side effect of this is that you can make use of the measurement tooltip while paused {{en/Flyspray|4292}} (r21480)
* Change: Make building aqueducts behave more like building tunnels. They cannot be built on flat (or foundationed) tiles, so there is at most one destination tile like there is only one for tunnels {{en/Flyspray|4153}} (r21471)
* Change: Place the bridge building window under the mouse instead of somewhere randomly on the screen and change the default sort order {{en/Flyspray|3975}} (r21460)
* Change: Make sure the client is listening, or rather receiving, our frames (r21361)
* Change: Read some metadata from (official) source tarballs so you will more likely get the right version/revision out-of-the-box (r21351)
* Change: Be more explicit that the game state can get broken by changing NewGRFs (r21335)
* Change: Use the last red instead of last red exit penalty for making sure other waypoint entries are evaluated as well when they are occupied, e.g. when there are no signals before the waypoint but a train just beyond the waypoint is stopped (like for stations) (r21271)
* Change: Do not receive money for removing the rail of non-rail rail station tiles, i.e. rail station tiles for which the NewGRF has prevented trains to be routed through (r21266)
* Change: Show a different 'lag' message when a client is lagging because of connection trouble or lagging because the client is just slow (r21254)

* Change: Limit the number of exceptions in the refittable cargo list to 7 (r21083)
* Change: Reduce the chances to accidentally break savegames with NewGRFs by limiting loading of savegames that miss NewGRFs or change NewGRF settings in-game {{en/Flyspray|3012}} (r21116)
* Change: Tuned realistic acceleration to be a bit more realistic in order to make acceleration 'slower', which highlights the differences between vehicle types more (r21106)
* Change: Do not make client reconnect waiting time depend on the company; in coop games that does not spread clients at all, and most companies have a low number causing it not to be spread out either. Use the ClientID instead. (r21008)
* Change: Add installing options or rather options to not install certain documentation, in a similar way to GRFCodec/catcodec (r20999)
* Change: Only display liveries in the livery window if they are used by some vehicle somewhen (r20849)
* Change: [NoAI] Rename AIAbstractList to AIList (r20563)
* Change: [NoAI] AIOrder::GetOrderFlags returns AIOrder::AIOF_INVALID for void orders (r20389)
* Change: [NewGRF] Adapt vehicle var FE bit 6 to new railtypes (r20175)
* Change: [NewGRF] Call callbacks 14A, 14B and 14C after all industry variables have been assigned, so more variables are valid during the callbacks (r19907)
* Change: [NoAI] Remove HasNext() from all lists/iterators and add IsEnd() instead (r19294)
* Change: Add the default installation directory of lzo/zlib for Mac OS X/MinGW to the paths where (the headers of) those libraries are searched {{en/Flyspray|3638}} (r19285)
* Fix: Crash due to cargo payments belonging to a non-existing company {{en/Flyspray|4324}} (r21605)
* Fix: Company league table used stats from two quarters ago instead of last quarter {{en/Flyspray|4323}} (r21601)
* Fix: The default visual effect only depends on properties of the Engine (wagon or not, tractiontype, ...), not whether it is used as articulated part, front engine or whatever in a specific consist {{en/Flyspray|4275}} (r21598)
* Fix: [OSX] A double mouse cursor was shown under certain circumstances {{en/Flyspray|2585}} (r21578)
* Fix: Show 'plant trees' button lowered on the terraform toolbar, like how other buttons are lowered when you selected a 'build' action {{en/Flyspray|4315}} (r21539)
* Fix: 2CC recolour sprites were the same for DOS and WIN palette, thus 'dark green', 'brown', 'grey' and 'white' were wrong for DOS {{en/Flyspray|4312}} (r21535)
* Fix: Do not apply the last signal red pathfinder penalty when the signal is a path signal {{en/Flyspray|4302}} (r21524)
* Fix: Tooltips were not removed when their related window got closed {{en/Flyspray|4300}} (r21477)

* Fix: The server did not check for the paused state when allowing to execute commands {{en/Flyspray|3771}} (r21429)
* Fix: Vehicles could be built while the game is paused. Now you can enable or disable that with a setting, which replaces the build-while-paused cheat {{en/Flyspray|4021}} (r21428)
* Fix: Purchase lists were not invalidated when using 'resetengines' (r21374)
* Fix: Fields were not cleared under snow though they were intended to be {{en/Flyspray|4283}} (r21367)

* Fix: Buffer overflow in strgen for strings with very large arguments (r21346)
* Fix: Bogus cache mismatch warnings with desync debugging because some cache was invalidated but never reset {{en/Flyspray|4272}} (r21338)

* Fix: Under some circumstances two vehicles could leave a non drive-through road stop at once {{en/Flyspray|3935}} (r21263)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Custom station foundations using the 'simple foundations'-method did not draw any sprite for WSE-slopes when there are foundations on both neighboured tiles in the north. As there must be at least one sprite to provide the correct offset for the groundsprite draw the (empty) default foundation sprite in that case {{en/Flyspray|4246}} (r21262)
* Fix: The main menu error messages would not show when you had an error message open in the game while whatever triggered you to go back to the main menu (r21255)
* Fix: Rescanning AIs did not 'forget' removed AIs {{en/Flyspray|3952}} (r21250)
* Fix: Upon rescanning AIs the new AIs would (after some time) show up in the AI list but you could not select all (r21246)

* Fix: [OSX] Finding a fallback font failed when compiling for OSX 10.4 as it tried to match also OpenTTD-specific control characters {{en/Flyspray|4001}} (r21197)
* Fix: Use non-interactive randomness for townnames on map generation, so they are controlled by the generation seed as well {{en/Flyspray|4226}} (r21192)

* Fix: Refit costs were not shown for long cargo names {{en/Flyspray|4160}} (r20921)
* Fix: When using non-smooth or NewGRF-economy changing production rates does not work, so allow changing the production multiplier instead (r20901)
* Fix: The station with the second highest rating was doubly penalised when distributing cargo. Now the penalty is completely removed and the granularity/precision of the distribution in increased by using fractional cargo. This should make competing stations less all-or-nothing {{en/Flyspray|3637}} (r20857)
