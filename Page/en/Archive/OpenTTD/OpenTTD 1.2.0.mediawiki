* Fix: [NoGo] Some news messages would cause an assertion to be triggered due to a missing proper location for the viewport of the news message, so only allow building when valid data for the viewport is provided or no viewport is used {{en/Development/Design Drafts/Flyspray|5054}} (r23924)
* Fix: Consider only the middle tile of a lock for lock-infrastructure costs. The other two tiles may be owned by other companies. Also do not count the middle tile of a lock as canal, independent of whether it is build on ground or river slope (r23920)

* Feature: [NewGRF] Give NewGRF defined level crossings and rail depots access to the townzone (r23866)
* Feature: [NewGRF] New algorithm (activated via an engine flag) to determine the capacity of vehicles. This allows vehicles to better control the capacity for cargotypes which they know; and let cargo NewGRFs influence the capacity for cargos the vehicle NewGRF does not know, but which the vehicle is refittable to due to cargo classes (r23861)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add cargo property 1D to set the capacity multipliers when refitting vehicles, which do not use callback 15 (r23860)

* Change: Make signs placed in scenario editor belong to the GS. That way they are always shown in game and are not editable {{en/Development/Design Drafts/Flyspray|4999}} (r23835)
* Fix: Generate industry subsidies again {{en/Development/Design Drafts/Flyspray|5039}} (r23876)
* Fix: [NoGo/NoAI] Scripts with a bad comparator could lock up OpenTTD {{en/Development/Design Drafts/Flyspray|5004}} (r23870)
* Fix: Make the colour of the dropdown items for opening the vehicle list for which the company has no vehicles looking less horrid {{en/Development/Design Drafts/Flyspray|5020}} (r23867)
* Fix: Railtype overlays were drawn 'only transparent' on invisible bridges (r23864)
* Fix: Inserting conditional orders for ships checked the wrong orders wrt. maximum distance (r23859)

* Fix: Infrastructure cache could get out of sync when overbuilding a drive through road stop (r23851)

* Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed infrastructure (r23847)

* Fix: [NewGRF] Failure to load newgrf files that use action 0 general prop 15 with a missing language file (r23788)
* Fix: Crash due to genders used for station name in hangar string of Italian translation {{en/Development/Design Drafts/Flyspray|4965}} (r23782)
