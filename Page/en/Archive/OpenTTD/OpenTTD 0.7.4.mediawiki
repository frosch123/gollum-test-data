===0.7.4-RC1 (2009-11-15)===
* Change: Prefer extmidi over allegro midi and allegro over null driver {{en/Flyspray|3272}} (r17875)
* Change: [NewGRF] Apply default refitmasks only when the NewGRF did not set any of the three refittability properties (xor mask, positive classes, negative classes) (r17663)
* Fix: Crash when an articulated RV is turning on a drive through road station that gets forcefully (bankrupt) removed {{en/Flyspray|3310}} (r18049)
* Fix: GCC 4.5 compiling (r18045)
* Fix: AIs failed to load their data from savegames by crashing them when they tried {{en/Flyspray|3290}} (r18038)
* Fix: Screen jumped a bit for at least SDL and Allegro when right-click-dragging (r18030)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Improve parsing of RIFF data. Skip unknown chunks and check chunk sizes (r17999)
* Fix: When you start giving money (input window for amount), then get moved to spectators and you click 'Ok' a crash would occur (r17953)
* Fix: Use 24bpp BMP format instead of 32bpp for screenshots. Saves space and is supported by more image viewers (r17943)
* Fix: Close BMP file when making screenshot fails (r17941)
* Fix: Deadlock when trying to create screenshot with too long name (including path) (r17936)
* Fix: Crash when closing NewGRF parameter window with no NewGRF selected {{en/Flyspray|3291}} (r17922)
* Fix: 32bpp BMP screenshots were in wrong colours on big endian machines and broken when screen width was not a multiple of 4 (r17910, r17909)
* Fix: Uninitialised values in some paths of loading TTO savegames {{en/Flyspray|3288}} (r17908)
* Fix: Make the plane speed setting unchangeable in network games because it can be read by NewGRFs on game load and thus if it changes cause desyncs (r17902)
* Fix: [NewGRF] 'subtract-in' is also signed for production callback version 0 (r17857)
* Fix: [NewGRF] _date_fract runs from 0 to 73 since r2041. Variable 0x09 should not (r17824)
* Fix: Do not fail hard when no soundcard could be detected; just fall back on the null-driver {{en/Flyspray|3268}} (r17788)
* Fix: CJK languages do not have spaces, so for adding newlines (multi line strings) we need to (properly) handle the case when there are no spaces instead of truncating the string {{en/Flyspray|3264}} (r17772)
* Fix: Powernaut Helicopter got wrong 'load amount' (r17758)
* Fix: [NewGRF] 'last_value' and 'reseed' are shared between procedure and main chain, 'scope' and 'count' are not (r17672)
* Fix: Count only active clients (not those waiting for map download) when checking min_active_clients limit (r16506)
