* Feature: Add Turkish town names as we have an official Turkish translation
* Feature: Add a fully optional configure script that is a wrapper around the cumbersome makefile.config

* Fix: Fix several glitches concerning foundations. Houses, property (rail/road/bridge/etc.) and cursor are now aligned properly
* Fix: Prohibit altering a road tile while road works are in progress. This fixes some glitches like 'turning' the excavation by adding/removing road bits or removing the road piece
* Fix: Only advertise the server to your external IP/network (eg not to 127.0.0.1) and use proper broadcast addresses
* Fix: '-f' switch is not valid on windows, so do not show it in help

* Fix: It was possible to convert the railtype of a bridge while a train was on it
* Fix: It was possible to rename signs or waypoints with the chat box
* Fix: Be more strict what it means for an aircraft to be in a hangar: It's not just being stopped on a hangar tile
* Fix: If a road vehicle is on a road depot tile and stopped does not mean it's in the depot. Use the proper test for this
* Fix: [AI] The AI should send a plane into a hangar if it's not in a hangar _or_ not stopped, not when it's not in a hangar _and_ not stopped

* Fix: [NTP] Fix NTP over bridges: do not check the rail type when on a bridge

* Fix: 'Erroneous train reversal on waypoints'. When processing the next train order, do not even consider reversing the train if the last order was to a waypoint
* Fix: Starting a new scenario did not adhere to local difficulty settings but took it from the scenario itself. That mode is for 'play scenario'

* Fix: Refresh build vehicle window (if opened) when converting rail depot
* Fix: Crash when sorting an empty server list
* Fix: The build-tree window button defaulted to a place-push-button on opening where no treetype is selected
* Fix: Game crashes when cloning/autoreplace reaches train-limit
* Fix: [NTP] Properly check for railtypes on non-plain-rail-tiles
