===0.7.1-RC3 (2009-06-03)===

* Fix: Base graphics names must be unique, so do not add duplicates (r16503)
* Fix: [NoAI] When an AI was suspended while in a function called (indirectly) via call/acall/pcall OpenTTD crashed. Fix this by disallowing AIs to be suspended while called via call/acall/pcall {{en/Flyspray|2935}} (r16502)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Invalidate NewGRF variable caches of more vehicles in more places. Esp. they were only invalidated for trains (r16480)

* Fix: [NoAI] CmdBuildTunnel could be called with invalid parameters from the API code, causing crashes later {{en/Flyspray|2875}} (r16243)
* Fix: Improve corner case order handling: mark order as done only when actually done, obey non-stop orders, do only stop/refit at the depot in the order (r16240, r16228, r16199, r16198, r16187)
* Fix: [NoAI] Use the stop/non-stop intermediate orderflags AIs can give for goto-depot orders (r16239)

* Fix: Forbid joining AI companies via the 'move' and 'join' console commands/multiplayer lobby (r16176, r16175)
* Fix: [NoAI] AIOrder::GetOrderDestination and AIOrder::GetOrderFlags did not work on ORDER_CURRENT when the vehicle was loading/leaving in a station (r16165)
* Fix: [NoAI] Change WAYPOINT_INVALID to 0xFFFF from -1 as that is the value the AIs got (due to casting) (r16150)

* Fix: Road was removed when both the Remove button was active and Ctrl was pressed {{en/Flyspray|2582}} (r16119)

* Fix: [NoAI] AIOrder::SetOrderFlags always removed "Service if needed" from goto-depot orders (r16106)
* Fix: Connect tried to validate too much of the company ID with too little information on hand {{en/Flyspray|2849}} (r16096)

* Fix: The language is called Slovak, not Slovakish (r16090)
* Fix: Insanely fast trains would not stop in time for stations/'jump' over waypoints/via stations within a tick, which would cause the order not to be processed causing the train to go in loops until (with luck) it 'hit' the tile {{en/Flyspray|2824}} (r16079)

* Fix: Storing/loading some currencies failed due to inconsistent settings "tables" {{en/Flyspray|2826}} (r16028)
* Fix: Usage of uninitialised memory when trying to build a random new industry, but there are no industrytypes to choose from (i.e. all appearance probabilities are zero) (r16027)
