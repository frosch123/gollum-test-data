(none)

===1.3.2-RC2 (2013-07-13)===
* Fix: [Admin] End-of-rcon data could not be determined reliably for any rcon command {{en/Flyspray|5643}} (r25598, r25588, r25587)
* Fix: [Content] When the server closed the connection, the client would for eternity try to read a packet and never timeout making it impossible to reconnect {{en/Flyspray|5635}} (r25597)
* Fix: [Script] Changing the script difficulty level in-game would also change the settings using the default even though they were not allowed to change in-game {{en/Flyspray|5644}} (r25592)
* Fix: [Admin] Ensure that sent and received length of json strings are the same {{en/Flyspray|5646}} (r25590, r25589)
* Fix: [Squirrel] Stack overflow did not show an error, due to the stack to throw the error already being full {{en/Flyspray|5320}} (r25585)
* Fix: [Script] Documentation implied that XXList::AddItem has a default for value if it isn't filled in {{en/Flyspray|5638}} (r25579, r25577)
* Fix: Layouter caused significant slowdown with text heavy windows, cache it to make it manageable (r25574, r25570, r25569, r25567, r25564)
* Fix: Make content list appear faster (r25573)
* Fix: Non-ICU layouter started new lines with the space which triggered the linebreak (r25568)
* Fix: If the next order cannot be resolved, reset the current order property instead of leaving it in an intermediate state {{en/Flyspray|5633}} (r25562)
* Fix: [Squirrel] Infinite recursion loop in freeing data via a looping set of references {{en/Flyspray|5568}} (r25558)
* Fix: One could build bridges over owned land of another company {{en/Flyspray|5524}} (r25557)
* Fix: [Script] Texts from scripts were not validated before they were shown, causing an assertion to trigger {{en/Flyspray|5632}} (r25555)
* Fix: Provide a warning when no vehicles are available, and tell what to do in that case {{en/Flyspray|5530}} (r25553)

* Fix: [Windows] Race condition between two drawing threads could crash OpenTTD {{en/Flyspray|5571}} (r25550)
* Fix: ICU returns the width of the visual run as if the trailing space was added (in case a newline was added). This caused the width to be more than the requested width, but it would still be drawn correctly {{en/Flyspray|5626}} (r25547)
* Fix: Small memory leaks (r25546)
* Fix: [GS] The checks and validations for setting the extra text in the town window became too stringent {{en/Flyspray|5625}} (r25544)
