=What's in OpenTTD that wasn't in the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe?=

OpenTTD is modeled after the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch] while others are original. You have also here a [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features]].
