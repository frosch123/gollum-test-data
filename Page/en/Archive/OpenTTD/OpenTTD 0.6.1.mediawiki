==Changelog==

===0.6.1 (2008-06-01)===

* Fix: Industry tiles would sometimes tell they need a 'level' slope when they do not want the slope (r13348)
* Fix: Attempts to make the old AI perform better (r13217, r13221, r13222)
===0.6.1-RC2 (2008-05-21)===

* Fix: Do not send rcon commands of the server to the first client but do directly execute those on the server (r13137)
* Fix: For multiheaded engines, halve power and running cost when used instead of when loading, to allow callback values to work properly (r13074)
* Fix: Loading of TTDP savegames with rivers in them {{en/Flyspray|2005}} (r13066)
* Fix: Update build industry window when raw_industry_construction setting is modified (r13060)
* Fix: Revert changes to multihead engine weight -- the original values were correct (r13023)
* Fix: Debugging was not possible with MSVC 2008 (r12996)
* Fix: List used for sorting GRFs was not freed (r12993)
* Fix: Default difficulty settings were different to TTD's original settings {{en/Flyspray|1977}} (r12951)
* Fix: All vehicles would be available when an original scenario would be played {{en/Flyspray|1982}} (r12948)
* Fix: Keep only first 15 bits for non failed callback results (r12947)
* Fix: Reading/modifying invalid data under some circumstances (r12943)
* Fix: Minor errors related to industries accepted/produced cargo (r12933)
* Fix: Town rating was affected even after the test run (r12920)
* Fix: Flood road tiles even when there are road works in progress {{en/Flyspray|1965}} (r12919)
* Fix: Do not initialize Station struct with tile=0, buoys will never change that value {{en/Flyspray|1960}} (r12915)
* Fix: Game crash when a spectator/server tried to show an engine with no owner when a NewGRF requested a specific variable (r12914)
* Fix: Report reverse sprite status (FD/FE) to NewGRF for manually toggled vehicles (r12910)
* Fix: Vehicles going twice to a depot when the automatic service interfered with the current order {{en/Flyspray|1985}} (r12629)
===0.6.1-RC1 (2008-04-26)===

* Fix: Vehicle groups, engine replacement rules and player/company names were not properly reset/freed after bankrupt (r12906)
* Fix: Remove trams from savegames saved in OTTD without tram support, it is better than to simply crash {{en/Flyspray|1953}} (r12904)
* Fix: GCC on FreeBSD does not support -dumpmachine causing configure to fail. Use g++ instead {{en/Flyspray|1928}} (r12876)
* Fix: Make the town rating tests use less memory and much quicker (r12859)
* Fix: Usage of AutoPtr made (trying to) build stuff very (time) expensive (r12857, r12855)
* Fix: Ensure that prop 25 is set for all vehicles in the consist before other properties as it could cause desyncs (r12856)
* Fix: Too much catenary was drawn about tunnel entrances, middle bridge pieces and non-rail station tiles (r12853, r12852)
* Fix: Use YAPF for fairly old savegames from before YAPF was introduced (r12845)
* Fix: The industry tick trigger should only be triggered once every 256 ticks, not every tick... Also bail out of the triggers a little earlier if you know they are not going to happen anyway (r12844)
* Fix: Inconsistent use of 8/15-bitness of NewGRF callback results with respect to TTDP's implementation of the specification (r12819, r12818, r12759)
* Fix: Possible out of bounds array access (r12809)
* Fix: Enforce autorenew values range in command (r12808)
* Fix: Vehicles could break down during loading and keep loading. The intention of the break down code is not to break down when having zero speed, therefor break downs now do not happen when loading {{en/Flyspray|1938}} (r12795)
* Fix: [OSX] In some rare cases when using an uncalibrated monitor the system colour space could not be retrieved. Show an error when this happens instead of just trying an assertion (r12776)
* Fix: Slope checking for NewGRFs failed (r12759)
* Fix: Check the TILE_NOT_SLOPED flag of the _north_ tile of multi-tile houses to decide if autoslope is allowed (r12717)
* Fix: Do not move windows below the toolbar on resizes unless they would go behind the toolbar {{en/Flyspray|1904}} (r12714)
* Fix: Increase default sound buffer size only for Vista {{en/Flyspray|1914}} (r12708)
* Fix: Do not crash very hard on unrecognised savegames, just go back to the intro menu instead (r12707)
* Fix: In some cases a news messages would not be shown {{en/Flyspray|1906}} (r12683)
* Fix: Removing road pieces from a town gave you twice the intended penalty {{en/Flyspray|1920}} (r12682)
* Fix: When a road vehicle has a tram only stop multiple times in a row in it's orders, only the first one would be skipped {{en/Flyspray|1918}} (r12678)
* Fix: Colour remaps on station sprites only worked for company colours {{en/Flyspray|1902}} (r12674)
* Fix: Remove buggy buoys at tile 0 from old TTDP savegames (r12642)
* Fix: Possible NULL pointer dereference when reading some NewGRF data {{en/Flyspray|1913}} (r12637)
* Fix: Infinite loop in case your compiler decides that enums are unsigned by default (r12622)
* Fix: The convert signal button disallowed signal dragging when the signal GUI was closed (r12577)
* Fix: Binding to a specific IP could cause OpenTTD to not register properly with the masterserver if one has multiple external interfaces (r12574)
* Fix: min() has 32bit arguments, clamping of 64bit values did not work (r12572)
* Fix: Towns could not terraform when inflation rised terraform prices enough (r12564)
* Fix: Do not affect town rating change by the order in which we examine stations (r12561)
* Fix: Redraw the signal GUI when the signal drag density changes in the patch settings and vice versa (r12553)
* Fix: Do not install scenarios into the current user's homedir when running 'make install', that is silly. Simply always install scenarios system wide instead (r12542)
