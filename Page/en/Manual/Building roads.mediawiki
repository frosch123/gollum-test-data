In this tutorial, you can learn how to '''build''' and '''delete roads''' for vehicles (busses or trucks) to load and unload passangers or cargos.

__TOC__

==How do I lay roads?==

First of all, you must open the ''Road construction'' toolbar - click the ''Road construction'' button [[File:en/Roadcnstr.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#The_Menu_bar|menu bar]]:
[[File:en/Road constructionnew.png|none|frame|The road construction toolbar]]

There are two ways you can lay roads:
* Using 2 directioned road section buttons.
* Using Autoroad tool.

== Building selected direction sections ==

Click on one of the road building buttons [[File:en/Build road.png]]. The example uses the 1st button.

=== Placing roads ===
#Move the cursor over the tile you want to start your road on.<br/>[[File:en/Build roads01.png|none|frame|Laying a new road]]
#Drag the cursor to where you want your road to end.<br/>[[File:en/Build roads02.png|none|frame|Laying a new road]]
#Release the mouse button and your new road will appear.<br/>[[File:en/Build roads03.png|none|frame|Your new road]]

* Note that this works with half-tile precision. If you e.g. click in the right half of a tile and then drag to the right the road will start with a half tile. The same applies for the end tile.

=== Removing roads === 
To remove the roads, '''select the Remove tool''' [[File:en/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]]. The white square will change to a red square. Now you can simply '''click & drag''' along the existing road sections to remove them. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.

== Using Autoroad tool ==
First '''select the Autoroad''' button [[File:en/Autoroad.png|Autoroad button]] from the road construction toolbar. You cursor will change to represent Autoroad feature.

=== Placing roads ===
#You can placing horizontal/vertical road sections (along squares). Put your cursor over any square and '''click & drag''' along the squares.<br/>You can click in a square and move your mouse in different directions to see how new roads would be placed.<br/>[[File:en/AutoroadTut2.png|none|frame|Laying a straight piece of tracks]]
#Release your mouse cursor and you will have built a straight section of roads.<br/>[[File:en/AutoroadTut3.png|none|frame|A newly built straight section of roads]]
#Placing diagonal roads is not posible.
#Autoroad tool works fine with hilly terrain, showing you how roads will be placed on a non-uniform landscape.

=== Removing roads ===
There are two ways to remove road sections (besides the dynamite [[File:en/Clear title.png|Dynamite tool]] tool)

*The easy way to remove roads is to hold down the CTRL key.

#To '''remove a section''' of roads, '''hold CTRL''' and '''click & drag''' along existing road section. Just as you would when building roads.<br/>[[File:en/AutoroadTut7.png|none|frame|Deleting roads (with CTRL)]]
#Release the mouse and the roads will be sold. Unlike rails, you will lose money by removing roads.<br/>[[File:en/AutoroadTut8.png|none|frame|A newly deleted roads]]

*The second way is to '''select the Remove tool''' ( [[File:en/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] ). The white squares will change to red squares. Now you can simply '''click & drag''' along the existing roads to remove them. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.
