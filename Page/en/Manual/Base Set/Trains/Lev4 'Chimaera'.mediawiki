|Description=The fastest locomotive in the game. This is a dual-headed train.

Using this engine to its full potential may give you some headaches late in the game. As it features a glaring 33% speed increase over the Lev3, 
you will either have to build bypasses into your network, or upgrade your entire fleet – which only works if you haven't maxed
out station length with the Lev3 already.

Also, this engine cannot go full speed on any bridge – the fastest bridge can handle 611 km/h, but the Chimaera's speed is 643 km/h, thereby needing a slowdown to go over bridged sections.

|Real-life=No Real-Life Equivalent has been found for this train. Perhaps in a few years, when MagLev has become a real technology, you could fill in a Fourth-Generation MagLev engine here. The train does resemble the [http://www.transrapid.de Transrapid] 9(?) trains, as well as the [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/StarSpeeder_3000 Starspeeder 3000] from the Disneyland attraction Star Tours.

As the only multi-headed maglev locomotive, "Chimaera" is a good name for it!
