|Description=This van can carry valuables between banks from cities above 1200 inhabitants. Unfortunately there are seldom banks generated due to small towns at the beginning of a random map. Since OTTD v0.6.0 you are able to [[en/Manual/Industries|finance]] banks in towns, unlike in version 0.5.x without a proper patch.
