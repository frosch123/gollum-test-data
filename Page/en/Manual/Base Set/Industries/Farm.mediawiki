'''Farms''' are always surrounded by farmland for a large area. Building on farmland does cost more, but the production of farms nearby is not affected.

The house(s) accept 1/8th passenger - so several farms on a small area may accept [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]].

If you want to place farms, remember that they must be built at least 3 tile heights below the (upper) snow line (sub-artic climate), or outside of deserts (sub-tropic climate).
