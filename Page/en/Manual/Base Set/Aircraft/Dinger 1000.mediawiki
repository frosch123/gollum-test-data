|Cost=164.062 (328,124)
|Speed=2,330 kph (1,448 MPH)
|Annual=7.059 (14,118)
|Designed=2013
|Lifespan=25
|Capacity=130 passengers & 45 bags of mail
|Description=Futuristic and Fictional. Apparently by Dinger/Fokker. Higher capacity than concorde, but not by much. Fastest and most expensive plane; for high-volume routes the bottleneck is at the airport, which in the long run favors the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Aircraft/Dinger 200]]'s larger capacity.
|Real-life=Fictional
