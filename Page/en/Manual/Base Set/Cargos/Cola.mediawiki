In OpenTTD, '''cola''' is the flat version of the popular drink of the same name.  It is obtained from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Cola Wells|cola wells]], which due to their mysterious and somewhat comical-looking nature of course only appear in the toyland [[en/Manual/Climates]].  The cola is then transported to a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Fizzy Drink Factory]] in order to have the bubbles put in and thereby be made into the more recognisable sparkling beverage.

Being a raw ingredient, cola is transported by tankers - it is only canned at the Fizzy Drink Factory.
