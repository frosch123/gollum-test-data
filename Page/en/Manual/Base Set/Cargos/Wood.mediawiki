In the [[en/Manual/Climates]] climate, [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Wood]] is used to make furniture (one of the many types of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]]). Trees are cut down at the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Forest]] and transported by you to the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Sawmill]] where they are further cut up and made into useful products.

In [[en/Manual/Climates]] regions, wood is not used for furniture but is instead sent to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Paper Mill|Paper Mills]] to be made into [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Paper]].

In [[en/Manual/Climates]] regions, wood must be supplied by the player using the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Lumber Mill]].
