'''Sweets''' is a cargo found in [[en/Manual/Climates]] only.  It's one of the toyland cargos that have more readily sources and better recipient range.  Sweets can be produced from any of the following:  [[en/sugar]], [[en/toffee]] or [[en/candyfloss]], and are transported to town houses.

Sweets correspond to [[en/food]] in [[en/sub-arctic]] and [[en/sub-tropical]] climates, and their logistics are almost identical.  For its convenience, sweets should be considered to be part of the freight backbone in Toyland climate games.
