'''Fizzy Drinks''' is a type of cargo appearing in [[en/Manual/Climates]] environment only.  The raw materials of Fizzy Drink are [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Cola]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Bubbles]].

Fizzy Drink somewhat corresponds to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] in tropical climate, but water in tropical climate must be transported to water towers, while fizzy drinks in [[en/Manual/Climates]] are accepted directly by town buildings.

Since the buildings accepting fizzy drinks are usually office buildings, fizzy drinks transport is only feasible for larger towns.
