'''Toys''' is the [[en/Manual/Climates]]-equivalent cargo to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]] in other climates.  Toys are manufactured from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Plastic]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Batteries]] in [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Toy Factory|Toy factories]].

Unlike normal goods, toys are transported to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Toy Shop]]s instead of town buildings.
