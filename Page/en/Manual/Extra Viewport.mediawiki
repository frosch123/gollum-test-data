In the minimap dropdown menu, open an extra viewport to have a quick look at your favorite map-positions. Multiple viewpoints can be opened, and independent zoom and quick jump functions are avaliable in the viewport. This is useful for keeping an eye on a certain part of the map while building elsewhere.
