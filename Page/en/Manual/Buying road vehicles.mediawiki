==How do I purchase road's vehicles?==

# To build a [[en/Manual/Road vehicles|road vehicle]], [[en/Manual/Building road depots|place a depot]] and then click it.
# You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles" and a new window will pop up with a list of vehicles.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 5.png|frame|none|Inside the depot...]]
# Select one and click "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window.
# The vehicle will appear in the depot window and the vehicle's control window will open.
# Give it [[en/Manual/Orders]] or [[en/Manual/Refit]] it as necessary, then click on the red "Stopped" button to get it rolling!<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Stopped bus.png|frame|none|Inside the depot...]]

==Giving orders to your road vehicle==
#In the vehicle window, click the ''Orders'' button [[File:en/Manual/Orders.png]]. 
#Click the ''Go To'' button, and then click on your first bus station with the special go to cursor. This will add an instruction to the vehicle's orders; ''Go to <station name>''. 
#Click ''Go To'' again, and add your second station to the vehicles order list in the same way. Once a vehicle has reached the end of its instructions, it will start over from the beginning.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 6.png|frame|none|Giving orders]]
#In the vehicle window, press the ''status bar'' at the bottom that says ''Stopped'', and your bus will leave the depot and start driving between the stations.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 7.png|frame|none|Your first bus is about to arrive at the bus station.]]

==How do I sell / delete road vehicles?==
There are a few ways to sell a road vehicle. You can sell one vehicle at a time, or sell all vehicles in a certain depot. Either way, the vehicles you want to sell need to be stopped inside the depot, so you need to send the vehicle to the depot first.

# Click on a road vehicle to open it's ''vehicle window''.
# Click the ''Send vehicle to depot'' button at the right side of the window.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-6.png|none|frame|Click on the road depot-like botton to send a road to the nearest depot.]]
# Now wait until the road vehicle has arrived at the road depot. In the meantime, you can close the road's vehicle window; you won't be needing that any more!
# As soon as the road vehicle has arrived at the road depot, click on this depot to open the ''Road Depot'' window. You now should be able to find the road vehicle in the depot's window.
# One way to sell the road vehicle is to drag it to the sell-vehicle-icon:<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-7.png|none|frame|Drag a road vehicle to the first of the three buttons at the right to sell it.]]
# Another way to sell a road vehicle is to click on the ''Sell all vehicles'' button: . Please note that this will sell all vehicles stopped inside the depot.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-8.png|none|frame|Click on the second button to sell all road vehicles which are stopped inside the depot. You'll be presented with a confirmation window asking if you're certain about what you're about to do.]]
