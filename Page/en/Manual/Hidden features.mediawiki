There are many features within OpenTTD with no GUI buttons or easily accessible to operate. To most inexperienced users, these are '''Hidden Features'''.

Here is a list of the hidden features, which are helpful, but not necessarily obvious even to experienced players. Feel free to complete this list.

This page does not list [[en/hotkeys]], see there for information.

==Ctrl features==
The Ctrl key can be very useful. Holding it down while clicking can make tedious tasks much faster.
