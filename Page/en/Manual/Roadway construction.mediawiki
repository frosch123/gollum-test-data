Roadways make for a good starting network as they are quick, cheap, and easy to build.  A roadway network will not be as profitable as a good railway network.  However, [[en/feeder service]]s built out of roadways can effectively complement a train network.

==Roadway construction toolbar==
Click the roadway build button [[File:en/Road build button.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#The_Menu_bar|menu bar]] to display the roadway construction toolbar.

Besides building on flat land roads, depots and stations can also be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|built on slopes]].

==Building road vehicles==
To build a [[en/Manual/Road vehicles|road vehicle]], place a [[en/depot]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles" and a new window will pop up with a list of vehicles. Select one and click "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The vehicle will appear in the depot window and the vehicle's control window will open. Give it orders or refit it as necessary, then click on the red "Stopped" button to get it rolling!

==Building one-way roads==
[[File:en/Oneway.png|right|frame|The sign with the arrow is the one-way build button]]
One-way roads are built by using the normal road build tools and clicking on the one-way road button. Roads will then be one-way in the direction they are dragged. One-way roads may also be built over previously built roads, but only if they are player-owned. Only the entrance tile to a stretch of roads needs to be one-way. Blocking tiles are built by dragging one way to build, then dragging over the other way.

[[File:en/Oneways.png|left|frame|All possible One-Way roads]]
The image shows all the possible roads. The first two show the one-way in the specific directions. The third one is a both-one-way road or to be more specific, it's a blocking tile. No vehicle can cross it (as the grf shows). The last one is the default road without any one-way direction. One-way bridges are not possible (yet?).

[[en/Manual/Tramways|Trams]] ignore whether the road is one-way or blocking. They'll always run over it in both ways.
