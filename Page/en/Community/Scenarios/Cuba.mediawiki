The scenario is based on a heightmap of Cuba from SRTM data. All the rivers are hand-placed with the help of maps. Cuba is a communist country, where no private transport companies exist. Given the chance,what kind of network would you build on this tropical island?
* All cities and towns have their original spanish names. Their size is 1/500th of the original.
* The industries are placed in the balance of real-life economies and game-play.
* While the scenario is Sub-Tropical, there aren't any deserts; Cuba is a tropical island filled with jungles.
