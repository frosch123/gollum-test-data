|description=Yeah, a toyland map and a quite old one too, because this is another map that was made with TTD in the late 90s. You can play it with any version of [http://www.openttd.org OpenTTD] and  [http://www.ttdpatch.net TTDPatch] or even TTD, if you want. The map is almost flat with a few little hills and medium sized towns.
