|description= "Where there's muck, there's money". A large scale map of South Yorkshire, England, from Wakefield to Sheffield using the Basic and Wood vectors of the ECS. You must load these two grfs. Replacement Town for OpenTTD grf is also recommended. There is no sea nor any rivers. The location of the towns are approximately correct, but apart from a few, I havent checked to see if they should have been placed on a valley floor or on the side of a hill. Huddersfield and Doncaster have been moved a little East and West respectively to fit them on the map. Apart from the major towns, all the others have been generated with smallish populations. Some of the industries have been located correctly, others to make an interesting game. There are two gold mines, but as far as I know Gold hasnt been discovered in real life - yet.
