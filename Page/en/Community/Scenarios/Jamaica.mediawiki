|description=This scenario makes it possible to build the whole island full of transport networks. With the oil wells in the north and in the south, the scenario delivers a great potential to exploit the whole island. You can even start setting up a boat service, which makes the coast villages grow, so you can build a passenger network a few years later. You can also choose to just build a gigantic railway network, that transports all kinds of products to the island's population.
