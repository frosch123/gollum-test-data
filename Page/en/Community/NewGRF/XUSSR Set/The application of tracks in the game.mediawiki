==The use of in-game tracks of DC, AC and dual-system. The Foundation for understanding the railway tracks. The combination of tracks during construction.==
:'''Railroad (100 km/h)''' is designed for movement not electrified the RS (steam locomotives,diesel locomotives and others). 
The game has the following types - '''Railway''', '''Railroad''', '''Trunk Railroad''' и '''High-speed Railroad'''. The main difference is the different speeds and different price, a single cell. In this regard, different application. Railway, for example, can be used as a low-activity railway to reach the enterprises and mines. Railroad, for example, can be used to reach the enterprises, mines. Trunk Railroad for a railway junction between major cities, enterprises, stations. High-speed Railroad for quick communication between cities. For example, high-speed locomotives with cars SV and compartment cars. Tracks without electrifying the cheapest, but the RS is the most expensive: locomotives are very expensive in the content, diesel is cheaper, but still not as effective as electric locomotives.
<br> In addition the railway, the game uses '''Electrified AC railroad''', '''Electrified DC railroad''' и '''Electrified double-system railroad '''. 
There are three types of DC tracks -  electrified DC  1,5kV rails (60 km/h), electrified DC  1,5kV railroad (100 km/h), trunk electrified DC 1,5kV railroad (140 km/h), high-speed electrified DC 1,5kV railroad (250 km/h), electrified DC  3kV railroad (100 km/h), trunk electrified DC 3kV railroad (140 km/h), high-speed electrified DC 3kV railroad (250 km/h). At AC the following types - electrified AC 15kV rails (60 rm/h), electrified AC 15kV railroad (100 km/h), trunk electrified AC 15kV railroad (140 km/h), high-speed electrified AC 15kV railroad (250 km/h), unlimited-speed electrified AC 15kV railroad, electrified AC 25kV railroad (100 km/h), trunk electrified AC 25kV railroad (140 km/h), high-speed electrified AC 25kV railroad (250 km/h), unlimited-speed electrified AC 25kV railroad. The use of different types of paths can be as on railway.

<br>The main difference of AC and DC in the game - the distribution of costs:
*DC - more expensive infrastructure, more cheaper the locomotive.
*AC - more cheaper  infrastructure, more expensive locomotive.
Accordingly, if included maintenance of the infrastructure, than, if the line is almost not used - it is necessary to take not electrified lines. If at the lines average flow of trains, than it is necessary to take AC, if a large number of trains, than it will be advantageous to use direct current (DC), because the difference in the cost of maintenance of railway tracks kompensiruet cheaper maintenance of locomotives.
If the content is off - have to take DC, what for AC do not overpay. <br>
Double-system areas are traversed by any locomotive. Used at the station to which come the branches, different electric current, in order for trains of any type can take any platform.
<br>Two system locomotive goes under the wires of any electrification. Need for a route connecting the objects on the branches, electrified at different currents. Given the mechanisms for the transfer of cargo in OTTD, apart from saving the time of unloading and loading at the splicing station, not profit.

In the game you can combine types of railway tracks. For example,  DC и railway, AC и railway, DC и double-system railway, AC и double-system railway. It is possible to concatenate different types of RS, depending on which are used way.

'''Example 1'''. The player bought the electric locomotive with several cars and was going to put it between the two settlements. But not all the way passes through the electrified road. Part of the way without power. To purchased the team was able to go all the way, need to buy an additional locomotive and concatenate with the team at the helm. After this, the player will only have to run the whole composition and see the way from one settlement to another.

<br> '''Example 2'''. The player bought the AC electric EMU - Epr. At one station alternating current is used, on the other - double-system current. Based on understanding about the double-system path, a player can only launch a train and observe the movement from one station to another.
