'''Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set''' or '''GRVTS''' is a [[en/Manual/NewGRF|newgrf]] vehicle set by [[en/Zephyris|Zephyris]]. GRVTS provides road vehicles and [[en/Manual/Tramways]] for all [[en/Manual/Climates]]s in dual [[en/Archive/Manual/Company Colours]], with articulated vehicles. This set uses [[en/Manual/Refit]]ting and generic cargo classes, so may be used with any [[en/Archive/Manual/NewGRF Industries|new industry set]] (although some cargos may use generic graphics).

An extended version of GRVTS, [[en/Community/NewGRF/Extended Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set]], also exists which includes many additional vehicles.
