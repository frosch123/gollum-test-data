NuTracks is a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] rail set developed by DJ Nekkid for OpenTTD.

Its a trackset ment to be used with the 2cc Trainset, but it is a stand-alone set, and can freely be used with any trainset, but some of its features might need some reprogramming of the set.


== History ==

As the feature is a quite new feature in OpenTTD (as of february 2010) the set is currently in developing state. Its main features such as speedlimits and priceing are finished, but there is no GFX added yet, but they are drawn (by Zephyris), and will be included soon.
