'''Extended Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set''' or '''eGRVTS''' is a [[en/Manual/NewGRF|newgrf]] vehicle set by [[en/Zephyris|Zephyris]]. eGRVTS provides an extended set of 218 generic road vehicles and trams, for all climates, in dual company colours. Includes vehicles from 1700 to 2075 with standard, express, double-decker, articulated, horse-drawn and steam vehicles. This set uses [[en/Manual/Refit]]ting and generic cargo classes, so may be used with any [[en/Archive/Manual/NewGRF Industries|new industry set]] (although some cargos may use generic graphics).

An simpler version of eGRVTS, [[en/Community/NewGRF/Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set]], also exists which does not require the [[en/Vehicle pool]] for use.

The columns show vehicle name, amount and type of cargo and whether it is refittable (R), top speed in km/h, and introduction year. The actual introduction years may vary, due to game mechanics. Armoured trucks also carry valuables or diamonds, depending on [[en/Manual/Climates]].
