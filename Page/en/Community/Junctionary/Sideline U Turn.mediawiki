== Inline loop ==

This little junction is good for low density networks with trains that are short enough to fit inside the loop or so [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles#weight-multiplier-for-freight-to-simulate-heavy-trains|heavy]] that they cannot scale even a single slope.

===Pros:===
*Cheap & small
*No sharp turns

===Cons:===
*Longer trains can block the mainline when in the turning lane

== Flyover loop ==

With the help of a bridge (or a tunnel) the U-turn loop can be made as wide as needed, without requiring any modifications to the mainline.

== Design tips ==
* Make sure that the turning spur is long enough that the longest train can fit completely inside it. Otherwise a train that took the turn will block the trains that go straight.
* Make sure to place a [[en/Manual/Signals#path-signals|path signal]] in front of the track split. Otherwise a turning train will block the straight direction even if it doesn't occupy the actual track. 
* There is no need for excessively wide turns, because the train that took the turn is likely to stop anyway when merging into the mainline.
* A bridge works slightly better than a tunnel, because its downward slope is located closer to the exit, and thus it will speed up the exiting train a bit longer.
* As with any sideline merge, it is a good idea to install a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Priority Merge|priority]].
