Similar to the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Half Transmogrified]] junction, but with tunnels instead of bridges and some tracks connect at different points.

{{en/Community/Junctionary/Junction Criteria|Average|2|1|0|3|1|1|1|1|0|0|0||Broken down trains affect one line.|

'''Pros'''
*High speed.
*High traffic capacity.
*Jams very unlikely.
*Small area.
*No sharp turns, can be easily built for any train length.
*Adequate waiting space for turning trains.

'''Cons'''
*Signaling gaps from tunnels. (doubling tunnels makes junction at least 2x2 tiles larger and harder to build)

'''Tips'''
*Start by building the "short diagonal" track first. Make its length equal to your longest train.

==Variations==
Here's a slightly different mainline example:

{{en/Community/Junctionary/Junction Criteria|Average|3|1|1|4|0|1|1|1|0|0|0||Broken down trains affect one line.|

'''Pros'''
*High traffic capacity.

'''Cons'''
*Slow, unless tracks are diagonal.
*Jams more likely than in ultimate 3-way junction.
*Requires space between tracks.
*Sharp turns, unless tracks are diagonal.
*Not enough waiting space for turning trains.
*Signaling gaps from bridges and tunnels.
*Bridges slow down high-speed maglev trains.
