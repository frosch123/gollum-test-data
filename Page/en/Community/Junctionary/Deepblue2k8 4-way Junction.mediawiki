===Pros===
* Just 2 turns for direction change with enough space between them.
* Branch before merge
* Easy to build

===Cons===
* Branches have different length
* Takes up large amount of space
* Many bridges

===Improvement===

Using both bridges and tunnels, we can reduce the number of hills for the trains, so that each train has at most one up-hill.
