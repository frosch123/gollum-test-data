The '''Right-of-way Roundabout''' is a combination of the [[en/Manual/Building depots]] and [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]] designs.  It uses [[en/Manual/Signals]] to give priority to trains traveling on the main lines.  The lowered areas of this junction create a roundabout large enough to hold four 10-car trains. Trains moving from the mainlines to the roundabout do so after passing through a long branch, so trains waiting to move onto the roundabout do not block the main line. Trains turning right have room to stop and not block the mainline if interrupted by a train exiting the roundabout.

The picture shows how trains traveling straight through the junction receive preferential treatment, and how merging trains need to wait until the main line is clear.
