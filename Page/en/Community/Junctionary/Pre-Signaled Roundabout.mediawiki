{{en/Junctionsmenu}}
The '''Pre-Signaled Roundabout''' is a combination of ideas.
The primary idea is the [[en/Manual/Building depots#advanced-depot-configurations|Right-of-way depots]] which uses signals to give priority to trains travelling on the main lines.
The second idea is your basic [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]]. One of the flaws of the Roundabout is that it can only handle 2 trains at a time. This slightly larger version can handle 4 trains.
Additionally, trains turning right do not need to enter the Roundabout, instead passing by on the outer paths. So even if 4 trains are in the inner loop, other trains can still make right turns.
The second flaw in a Basic Roundabout is that there is no preference given to exiting trains or entering trains. Using the Presignal Hack First described in [[en/Manual/Building depots#advanced-depot-configurations|Right-of-way depots]], we are able to give preference to trains exiting the loop. This greatly reduces the chance of a traffic jam. (I'm pretty sure the only condition that will cause a jam is four left turning trains entering the loop at exactly the same time.)

An additional benefit is that this is a junction that can be built very simple to start with, and then built up. For example, you can start with a square version of the basic Roundabout, and later on convert it into the Pre-Signaled version. This makes it very cheap to start with, and later when money is available the job can be completed.

[[File:en/PresignaledRoundAboutVariant.png|none|thumb|600px|Pre-Signaled Roundabout (advanced)]]
This is a little harder to build, but seems to be easier to find room for.

[[File:en/No-colide-roundabout-4w.png|none|thumb|600px|Pre-Signaled Roundabout (proved)]]
This is easy to build.  A train can enter if and only if there is no trains on the two following steps.
It has been proven that no deadlocks (or traffic-jams) can occur. This verification has been done using Petri Nets. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trains.png]
