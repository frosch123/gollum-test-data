==Variations==

[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Ttd.transmogrified.large.png|frame|none|Large transmogrified junction]]

With a larger central square 7 wagons may fit between the turns on the slow path.

[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Ttd.transmogrified.compact.png|frame|none|Compact transmogrified junction]]

In this compact configuration the junction is very slow.

[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Ttd.transmogrified.deblock.png|frame|none|Transmogrified junction]]

Unaligned but slightly smaller junction. Tunnels instead of bridges and no path based signaling.
