[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Distant-join.png|thumb|Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on a Mac) while building the station, then select an existing station to join]]
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Distant-join stations]] is an option available since r14919 or [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.7.0]].
It can be found in the "Stations" tab of the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] window.

If enabled, you can hold Ctrl while building any kind of station to see a list of nearby stations of your company. You can then choose any of them to join the newly built station with it, or choose "Build a separate station" to do so.

You can only join stations that are within the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Change station spread|station spread]] limit. Stations that are further away will not be shown in the selection window.
