It is possible within OpenTTD to write Scripts which can be used to automate specific tasks.
Unfortunately at present this functionality is a little buggy, but it does work.

Scripts comprise regular console commands, with the commands being run in sequence.

An example script:

 echo "Starting server"
 script openttd.log
 net_frame_freq = 1
 name "My Server"

If we then save the above script as <tt>.openttd/scripts/on_dedicated.scr</tt>, it will be run whenever a dedicated server is started, and do the following:

* It will Print "Starting Server" in the console window
* It will begin logging the non-debuging output from the console window to openttd.log
* net_frame_freq will be set to 1
* The server name will be set to "My Server"


If you want scripts to automatically run whenever you start a client, see [[en/Manual/Running Startup Scripts|here]]. To run scripts manually, simply use the ''exec'' command from the [[en/Manual/Console]].
