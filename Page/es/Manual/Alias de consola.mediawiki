== Alias Commands ==
Aliases are handy shortcuts for one or more command. You can define aliases ingame or in one of the scripts files. Simply add an alias by typing "alias <whateveryouwant>". If the alias needs spaces, remember to enclose it in double-quotes. If your alias needs double-quotes, use single quotes as subsitution. Like this: ''alias echo " 'hallo b' %A"''.
Aliases can use the arguments typed in after them.
*"%A - %Z" substitute arguments 1 t/m 26
*"%+" lists all parameters keeping them seperated
*"%!" also lists all parameters but presenting them to the aliased command as one argument
*";" allows for combining multiple commands (eg alias startgame "load 5; pause")
