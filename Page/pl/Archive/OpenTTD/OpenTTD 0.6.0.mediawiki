* Funkcja: Sort the NewGRFs by name, making searching a specific NewGRF a lot easier (r11175)
* Funkcja: Add possibility to show the bounding boxes of sprites using CTRL-B so one can get a better understanding of the used bounding boxes to fix the glitches that still exist. Note that showing the bounding boxes is not glitch free; it only gives you some knowledge where the bounding boxes are (r11174)
* Funkcja: Remove the arbitrary limit of 10 articulated parts for a vehicle (r11120)
* Funkcja: Autoslope, changing of slopes of tiles that already have something build on them. Does not work for tiles of houses/industries/stations that do not allow autosloping (r11107)

* Funkcja: [NewGRF] Add support for Action 13, which allows you to translate GRF-specific texts. The translations will only be shown if you are using a language with a GRF language id and if a string has not already been set specifically for the language you are using (r9037)
* Funkcja: Translation dependant formatting of dates (r8906)
* Funkcja: If an action 7/9 leads to skipping the rest of the file, disable the NewGRF if an action 8 has not been encountered yet (r8831)
* Funkcja: Stop loading and disable the current NewGRF if a fatal error message in Action B is encountered. Also be more strict on the values accepted (r8830)

* Zmiana w kodzie: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it {{en/Flyspray|1310}} (r11256)
* Zmiana w kodzie: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)
* Zmiana w kodzie: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)
* Zmiana w kodzie: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)
* Zmiana w kodzie: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)
* Zmiana w kodzie: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)

* Zmiana w kodzie: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)
* Zmiana w kodzie: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)
* Poprawka: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)

* Poprawka: Electric trains were not shown as stopped in depots when converting it from elrail -> normal rail {{en/Flyspray|1260}} (r11167)
* Poprawka: A lot of graphical glitches by changing some bounding boxes. It is not perfect yet, but a *very* good step into the right direction (r11128)
* Poprawka: When autorenew is enabled and it cannot renew the vehicle anymore (because the player cannot build the engine), the ageing warnings as if autorenew is not enabled are shown {{en/Flyspray|553}} (r11064)
* Poprawka: Inconsistency between rail<->elrail conversions of different kinds of rail containing tiles (normal rail, stations, depots, etc) {{en/Flyspray|1182}} (r11059)

* Poprawka: One could not give money when (s)he had too much money or rather: when casting the amount of money to an int32 becomes negative {{en/Flyspray|1174}} (r11020)
* Poprawka: When determining the gender of a string, do not assume that the gender is in the front of the string when there can be case switching code at that location {{en/Flyspray|1104}} (r10792)
* Poprawka: Determining whether there is a tunnel going under the lowered area is only needed in two directions instead of all four, so take the directions (one for each axis) to the nearest border (along the given axis) {{en/Flyspray|1058}} (r10686)

* Poprawka: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open {{en/Flyspray|1026}} (r10546)
* Poprawka: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable {{en/Flyspray|1028}} (r10541)
* Poprawka: Error dialog was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command {{en/Flyspray|1015}} (r10501)
* Poprawka: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)
