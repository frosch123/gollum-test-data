<div style="font-size:1.4em; font-weight:bold">[[Main/en/OpenTTD|Gameplay Manual]]</div>
The manual provides in-depth information on how to play.  If you are new to the game, our [[Main/en/Tutorial|Getting Started]] article will show you how to set up your first transport route, or you might like to try the [[Main/en/Tutorial|tutorial]]. 

If you've played Transport Tycoon before, you may like to read the [[Main/en/Changes from TTD|comparison of OpenTTD and Transport Tycoon Deluxe]] to see what's changed. If you've played [[Main/en/TTDPatch]] which contains some of the same improvements as OpenTTD, we also have a [[Main/en/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features|comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features]].

Finally, for any general questions check the [[Main/en/FAQ]].

This section covers all aspects of non-graphics OpenTTD development. For those new to development, the [[Main/en/FAQ development|FAQ]] should answer any questions you have.  You can then move on to current [[Main/en/Development|development]] or helping out with [[Main/en/Internationalization|translation]] if you wish. 

You can see the [[Main/en/Recent and Current Developments|latest developments]], [[Main/en/Roadmap|expected features for the upcoming releases]] and the [[Main/en/Requested features|requested features]] list if you're interested in the current state of the project. If you're already a developer, the [[Main/en/Development|Development Documentation]] is useful.

We also have a development community on our [[Main/en/IRC channel]] and in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33 development forum].

<div style="font-size:1.4em; font-weight:bold">Helping with the Documentation</div>
The OpenTTD documentation is stored and edited using this <em>wiki</em>. Feel free to start editing as soon as you feel you can, but '''read the [[Main/en/Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] first''', and make any tests in the [[Main/en/Sandbox|Sandbox]].  

Visit the [[Main/en/Village Pump|village pump]] to discuss any major changes or additions to the documentation, or you can start right in on requests posted in the [[Main/en/Requested Articles|article requests]]. Also:

*Some articles need smaller changes to satisfy our needs, and there is a [[Category/en/To do|list]] of these.  If you don't feel up to writing full articles then this may be a better place to start. 

*There are also some articles that require more work before they can be called finished, and you can browse them in [[Category/en/Articles to be expanded|Expand category]]. 

*Finally, there are articles concerning [[Category/en/Current events|current events]] which will become outdated often - why not check the information in these is still current if you have a spare moment?
