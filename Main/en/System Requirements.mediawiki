The system requirements for OpenTTD can be highly variable depending on several factors. These factors include map size, number of vehicles, and number of [[Main/en/NewGRF|NewGRFs]]. Minimum recommend system specifications have been outlined below based on experience. These specifications won't allow for all the bells and whistles, but they will let the game run and be playable to some extent. Using a modern PC will allow for the best game play experience.

==All Operating Systems==

Any installation of OpenTTD needs a [[Main/en/Installation FAQ|few files]] in order to run.
