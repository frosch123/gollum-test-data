<!--The '''Quad Branch-Merge Junction''' is the direct evolution of the [[Main/en/Branch-Merge Junction]] and [[Main/en/Dual Branch-Merge Junction]]; allowing four entrances and four exits, in essence doubling the appropriation power of a Dual Branch-Merge Junction.  Although still in its infancy, the quad branch-merge junction is able to handle quite a load of [[Main/en/Mammoth trains|large trains]] (20 cars) with very few backups.

Speculation of [[Main/en/New Bridges|angled track]] in the [[Main/en/nightly build]]s under existing [[Main/en/bridges]] will allow at least a 50% increase in [[Main/en/trains|train]] speed; eliminating eight turns that currently reduce it to below 100mph (161km/h).  The sharpest turns are illustrated in [[Main/en/Image:Sharpcorners.PNG|Figure B]]:
