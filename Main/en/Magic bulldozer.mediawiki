[[Translation:Main/en/Magic bulldozer]]
'''Magic Bulldozer''' is a [[Main/en/Cheats|cheat]] that enables the user to destroy anything including industries, lighthouses, etc. This can be useful if a town will not let you destroy a house for example when you want to build a railway through that tile.

However, this also allows town local authorities to remove such objects as well; therefore, it is not recommended to have this setting on for long to avoid losing things you might want to keep.
