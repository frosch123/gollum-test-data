==hs.dat==
The high scores are stored in the file hs.dat, which can be found in the directory that also holds the [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg|openttd.cfg]] file (either the OpenTTD program directory or a shared directory). Delete this file (hs.dat, not openttd.cfg) if you want to clear the high score chart.
