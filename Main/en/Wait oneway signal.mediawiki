[[Translation:Main/en/Wait oneway signal]]
Sets the wait-time in seconds for one-way [[Main/en/Signals|signals]]. After this time-out, trains will turn around to see if there is an alternative route. 

Possible values are between 2 and 255. A value of 255 is special as it indicates that a train wait forever at the signal without turning.
