'''Fizzy Drinks''' is a type of cargo appearing in [[Main/en/Climates#Toyland]] environment only.  The raw materials of Fizzy Drink are [[Main/en/Cola]] and [[Main/en/Bubbles]].

Fizzy Drink somewhat corresponds to [[Main/en/water]] in tropical climate, but water in tropical climate must be transported to water towers, while fizzy drinks in [[Main/en/Climates#Toyland]] are accepted directly by town buildings.

Since the buildings accepting fizzy drinks are usually office buildings, fizzy drinks transport is only feasible for larger towns.
