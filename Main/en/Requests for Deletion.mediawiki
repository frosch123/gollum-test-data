This logo is the London Underground "Roundel" logo, which is a trademark of Transport for London.  Therefore, we cannot use it in-game, and so displaying it here is redundant.  In terms of its use as an icon for "stations", it's also not intuitive, as those outside London probably won't make the connection, but that's secondary to the trademark issue.
