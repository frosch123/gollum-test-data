'''Batteries''' provide the much needed power to make toys work.  Unlike real life, batteries ''are'' included with OpenTTD toys, so you'll need to deliver them to the [[Main/en/Toy Factory|toy factories]].

Batteries are produced by [[Main/en/Battery Farm|battery farms]] where they are grown using methods understood by few.

==Background==
You can read more about batteries at [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery (electricity) ], although that article doesn't shed any light on the growth process {{en/Emoticon|:D}}.
