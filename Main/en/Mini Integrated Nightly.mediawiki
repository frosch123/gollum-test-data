{{en/Historic|The development of MiniIN has been stopped, read more about in this [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=24423&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=1080 thread]. MiniIN was discontinued as of 31 December 2006.}}
{{en/-}}

The '''Mini Integrated Nightly''' was a special build of [[Main/en/OpenTTD]], which incorporates patches which have yet to be approved for the main code.  It was maintained by [[Main/en/richk67]].  ''"Its like OTTD's smarter younger brother; a bit dirty and smelly at times, but tons of energy, and lots of ideas - some more realistic than others."''[http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=469054#469054] --richk67

==Description (non-technical)==
While there are a core set of programmers who work on the major improvements and administer the project, anybody is allowed to code their own improvement for OpenTTD.  However, until that improvement gets approval from the core administers, it will not be integrated into the main game.  Until that time, the improvement generally sits in the development forum in the form of a source code [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]].

Anybody with a compiler can take a patch or any number of patches and create their own version.  But not all OpenTTD users know how to compile code.  The other problem of course is that patches often conflict with each other.

The answer: The Mini Integrated Nightly (or MiniIN for short)

The requirements are much less strict for a patch to be included into the MiniIN, so quite a few patches are included as quickly as possible. Small neat patches are more likely to be applied quickly - it has been known for a patch to be added within hours of its first posting on the forums.

The term "nightly" refers to the [[Main/en/Nightly build|Nightly Builds]], which contain the latest changes made by the core programmers.  "Integrated" refers to all the patches being integrated into the nightly build.  "Mini" refers to the fact that this is the second generation of Integrated Nightly's, and there are a few requirements before a patch will be included.

==Downloading the Mini Integrated Nightly==
The executable files are automatically compiled, and this is what is known as a [[Main/en/nightly]].  Despite its name, the nightly builds for the MiniIN are only built every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday (23:00 CET, 22:00 UTC). If there aren't any changes in between those three days, you just have to wait.

The latest MiniIN nightly build can be downloaded at: 

http://nightly.openttd.org/MiniIN/files/ 

Be sure to download the version for your Operating System.

==Common problems==

==== Using PBS ====

To use PBS you need to ''turn on'' New Global Pathfinder (NPF) and ''turn off'' YAPF. Note that NPF is not as efficient as YAPF and that performance might be adversely affected.
==== Planeset not introducing planes correctly====

This is a common type of error if you install the planeset GRF and try to use it on an existing savegame. This error may affect all types of new vehicle sets. It will not occur if you start a new game after loading a vehicle set.

To fix the problem, press ~ (Tilde, next to 1 on the keyboard.), and type ''resetengines''.
==== Configuration File Error ====
[[File:en/MiniIN Config File Error.gif]]

This is a very common type of error to see when you first install the MiniIN.  A lot has changed in the MiniIN, and your old configuration files basically are no longer valid.  It's not a big issue, as the game will still run even with an invalid configuration file.  However, you probably want to fix it, you have two options:

1. Delete '''openttd.cfg''' from the OpenTTD home directory.  You'll lose your default settings.  It's worth it though!

2. Open the '''openttd.cfg''' and delete all what you get after the = of the display_opt entry (you should have then "display_opt = "). This option is the preferred, as you only need to reset the display options when in game, like '''Show Town Names''' or '''Full Detail'''

==Patches Included==
A few lists of patches included in or up for review for the Mini Integrated Nightly as of r5311(?). See [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=426901#426901 the forum] for a possible more up to date list.

If you download the source code, this list can be found in [http://svn.openttd.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/browser/branches/MiniIN/patches/MiniINpatches.txt /patches/MiniINpatches.txt].

==Development==
This section contains the technical details for obtaining the code and creating special patches for the MiniIN

====Downloading the MiniIN code====
Using a Subversion program, you may download any revision of the code from '''svn://svn.openttd.org/branches/MiniIN'''

====Viewing the Changelog====
The complete changelog can be viewed here: 

'''http://svn.openttd.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/log/branches/MiniIN'''

This is a great way to stay on top of all the changes, and even better for updating this wiki!

====Create a patch for the MiniIN====
Ok, so you've created your very cool patch and want users to try it out?  Several people will look at it if you build your own executable, but even more will look at it if you include it into the MiniIN.  Here's how:

First, make sure that you meet the requirements for having your patch included:
:*Wait a month and test your patch before requesting inclusion in the MiniIN
:*No debugging code
:*"Idle" commented-out dev code removed
:*Any trailing spaces removed; regexp: /s/[\t ]+$//
:*Applies to MiniIN branch (resolve conflicts as best you can)
:*Compiles without any errors or warnings (other than non-fatal language warnings)
:*If you have an update, or a bug fix, please say *what* has changed or what the current version number is in the forum topic.

Next, create an actual patch against the MiniIN (The steps below apply to users of TortoiseSVN):
:#Check out trunk at either pre-branch (4977), or current last sync (check the branch for details).
:#Apply patch
:#Use the Tortoise "Switch" option to point to '''svn://svn.openttd.org/branches/MiniIN'''. It will run a merge, and you may get conflicts.
:#Resolve conflicts.
:#Create patch.

====Maintaining your patch in the MiniIN====
If you make a new version of your patch and need to update it in the MiniIN, pretty much you follow the same method as when you first put it in.  Your new code will most likely conflict with your old code, so always compile and run your patch to make sure you haven't left any orphaned lines of code in.

'''BIG NOTE:''' When your patch is first added, richk67 will change any settings you added in settings.c:

<pre>
Before:
SDT_VAR(Patches, day_length, SLE_UINT8, NS, 0, 1, 1, 32, STR_CONFIG_PATCHES_DAY_LENGTH, NULL), 

After:
SDT_CONDVAR(Patches, day_length,  SLE_UINT8, 34, SL_MAX_VERSION, NS, 0, 1, 1,   32, STR_CONFIG_PATCHES_DAY_LENGTH, NULL),
</pre>

This is to keep savegames backwards compatible.  Do not revert these, and do not change the 3rd and 4th parameters.  More info at [[Main/en/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Settings/AddSetting]]

When you upload your update patch, please notify everyone on [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=26333 this forum thread].  You may upload the file to the individual patch thread or to the MiniIN patch forum thread.  Then feel free to add a link to the Update Available like this: 

:<nowiki>[http://link-to-update/ Yes]</nowiki>
