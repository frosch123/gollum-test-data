'''Sweets''' is a cargo found in [[Main/en/Climates#Toyland|Toyland]] only.  It's one of the toyland cargos that have more readily sources and better recipient range.  Sweets can be produced from any of the following:  [[Main/en/Sugar|sugar]], [[Main/en/Toffee|toffee]] or [[Main/en/Candyfloss|candyfloss]], and are transported to town houses.

Sweets correspond to [[Main/en/Food|food]] in [[Main/en/Climates#Sub-arctic|sub-arctic]] and [[Main/en/Climates#Sub-tropical|sub-tropical]] climates, and their logistics are almost identical.  For its convenience, sweets should be considered to be part of the freight backbone in Toyland climate games.
