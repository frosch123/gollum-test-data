A vehicle is one of the fundamental entities in the game.

==Types==
There are 6 recognised vehicle types in the VehicleType enum:
* VEH_TRAIN: A train or carriage. Makes use of a linked list for the carriages.
* VEH_ROAD: A bus or truck. Will probably use the same linked list for articulated vehicles.
* VEH_SHIP
* VEH_AIRCRAFT
* VEH_SPECIAL
* VEH_DISASTER

There are many more methods and variables than this. For more info, see vehicle_base.h and vehicle.cpp. Vehicles are all subclassed, so there are other more specific methods and variables for trains, etc.
