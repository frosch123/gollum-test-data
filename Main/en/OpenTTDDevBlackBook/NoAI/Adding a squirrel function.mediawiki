==Adding a squirrel function==
To make a new C++ function available to the Squirrel code of the NoAI framework, do
* Implement the function
** Add the function declaration to one of the classes in ''src/ai/api/ai_*.hpp'',
** Also add an implementation in the ''.cpp'' file,
** To make Squirrel aware of the changes, generate a new Squirrel interface file with ''squirrel_export.sh''. Call that script from within the ''src/ai/api'' directory.
* Recompile OpenTTD in the usual way to make the new function available to the NoAI framework.
* Write test-cases for the new function in ''bin/ai/regression''.
** In ''regression.nut'', add Squirrel code that tests your new function, and outputs results.
** In ''regression.txt'', add the new expected output.
* Run the regression test by executing ''make regression''. When differences are found, they will be displayed.
* Add the function to the NoAI changelog in ''src/ai/api/ai_changelog.hpp''.

When all works as expected, you can write some Squirrel code to enjoy using your new function.
