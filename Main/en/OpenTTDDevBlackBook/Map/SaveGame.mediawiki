== Savegame File Format ==
Savegame files (including scenario files) consist of an 8-byte header followed by the actual savegame data in a compressed or plain form. Four types of file formats are supported by OpenTTD so far.

=== Header ===

{|
| '''Offset''' || '''Size''' || '''Description'''
|-
| 0 || 4 bytes || Savegame format tag in plain text (see below)
|-
| 4 || uint32 || Savegame version in big endian format (currently it's SAVEGAME_VERSION * 0x10000)
|}

=== Savegame Format Tag ===

{|
| '''Tag''' || '''Savegame body format'''
|-
| OTTD || Data compressed using LZO
|-
| OTTN || Plain data
|-
| OTTZ || Data compressed using Zlib
|-
| OTTX || Data compressed using LZMA
