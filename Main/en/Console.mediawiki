| style="background:none; border:0px" | The '''console''' allows you to see [[Main/en/Multiplayer|multiplayer]] chat history and to execute command-line commands in [[Main/en/OpenTTD]]. Most of the commands are used to configure multiplayer [[Main/en/Server|servers]].

[[File:en/Console.png|none|frame|The OpenTTD Console]]
|}

==Using the console==
Open the console with the tilde key (~), located to the left of '1' on the main keyboard. On some [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard layout international keyboards] the symbol may differ (e.g. on the [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard layout#Germany and Austria (but not Switzerland) German keyboard] it is ^ TWICE).  There is also a "Toggle Console" option in the help menu.<br />
After the console is open, type in a command, such as "help" and press Enter.  

Tips:
* Scroll the console with Shift + Up/Down or Shift + Page up/Page down.
* Scroll through the input history with the Up/Down arrow keys.
* Make the console bigger with Ctrl + Enter.
* Paste text from the clipboard with the normal Ctrl + V (Windows only).

==Console commands==
Here is a list of all the console commands available in OpenTTD. Brackets [] mean "optional". A vertical line | means "or". Underscores _ in the command name are optional. The list is organized with the most useful commands at the top.  This list is also available [[Main/en/Console Commands|alphabetically]].
Remember that quote marks are supposed to be written in the console too!
