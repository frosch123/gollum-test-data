[[Translation:Main/en/Player name]]
{{en/Note|Newer versions call this option <code>client_name</code>}}
<br><br/>
This property defines the name you will have when you play [[Main/en/Multiplayer|multiplayer]]. It is considered polite not to leave the name as 'Player'. It doesn't have to be anything special - possibly your nickname, forename, or initials. Use your imagination. This name identifies you to other players in a [[Main/en/Multiplayer|multiplayer]] game and is useful for identifying senders of [https://wiki.openttd.org/Multiplayer#Chatting messages] or in [https://wiki.openttd.org/Multiplayer#Client_list sending players money].
<br><br/>
When first joining a multiplayer game your [[Main/en/Transport company|Transport Company]] will likely be named after you (e.g. if you set your name to "Jeff" then your company will be "Jeff" Transport by default).
