* Fix: Flush the output of the dedicated server console (r10295)
* Fix: The "pause" key did not work in the scenario editor (r10294)

* Fix: Do not make everyone spectator if 1 joining client failed to create new company (r10284)

* Fix: Train disconnects in some old TTD savegames {{en/Flyspray|862}} (10151)

* Fix: When you got a sufficiently small resolution, there is a possibility for a division by zero when a sound is played (r10138)
* Fix: When removing a dock, a ship will always try to reach the old location of the dock even when it cannot anymore because it the old location of the dock is now land instead of water {{en/Flyspray|810}} (r10131)
* Fix: SetCurrentGrfLangID returned the wrong language ids for most languages (r10130)
* Fix: Some NewGRFs use the same (unused in the "current" climate) sprite IDs. Normally this gives some artefacts, but when one NewGRF expects it to be a sprite and another NewGRF overwrites it with a non-sprite nasty things happen (drawing a non-sprite crashes OTTD) {{en/Flyspray|838}} (r10109)
* Fix: Multiple subsequent "give money" actions could result in duplicate messages that money has been transfered when it only happened once, or tell you paid money when you did not {{en/Flyspray|834}}, {{en/Flyspray|839}} (r10087, r10085)
* Fix: "Deactivate Electrified Railways" did not work {{en/Flyspray|836}} (10083)

* Fix: Do not use override engine type for articulated wagon parts (r10048)
* Fix: Sprite resulting from '?' substitution was reloaded into the cache entry for SPR_IMG_QUERY instead of the original sprite cache entry. This resulted in unaccounted missing sprite cache memory, and was exacerbated because the original missing sprite was not cached, so it did it again and again and again. Slowdowns and boom (r10038)
* Fix: One could build on (some) slopes when building on slopes was disabled {{en/Flyspray|823}} (r10030)
* Fix: When deleting the first engine of a train with multiple engines, only reopen the train window if the player had the original train window open. This fixes 'random' windows opening for multiple players of the same company (r10028)
* Fix: When selling trains, if there were no wagons between multiheaded engines the rear part could be checked despite having already been deleted (10023)
