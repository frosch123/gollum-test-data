[[Translation:Main/en/AI settings]]{{en/Table of contents}}

Since 0.7.0, the so-called NoAI framework was introduced into OpenTTD, which allows users to create their own [[Main/en/AI:Main Page|AIs]]. These AIs can be handled in the ''AI Configuration'' window. Click the ''AI Settings'' button in the main menu.

==Downloading AIs==
First of all, you have to download some AIs via the [[Main/en/Online content]] system. Click the ''Check Online Content'' button in the ''AI Configuration'' window and you are able to download them.

Further AIs can be found on the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65 NoAI forum]. If you use the online content system, then it will also select the required AI libraries for the AIs that you download. If you on the other hand download AIs from the forum or other places, then you need to make sure to also download the right versions of the libraries used by that AI unless you already have them.

==Selecting AIs==
After you downloaded AIs, click the ''AI settings'' button in the main menu. There you can configure the number of AI competitors in the game, and then choose an AI for each company slot.
Click on one of the company slots, then click ''Select AI''. In the new window, you will see a list of the downloaded AIs. Pick one, and then click ''Accept''.

==Configuring AIs==
If you click on a company slot, and then you click ''Configure'', the AI configuration window opens.

These settings (except the first one) are added individually by the different AI authors, and they determine the playing style of that AI. You can use multiple instances of the same AI with different settings.
The AIs will start automatically after a given amount of days, with some minor random variation.

==Using the console==
You can use the in-game [[Main/en/Console|console]] to start and stop AIs.
Console commands for handling AIs:

'''list_ai''' - lists the currently installed AIs.

'''rescan_ai''' - scans the AI folder for AIs, this is needed if you install an AI while you are playing the game.

'''start_ai''' ''<ainame> <parameters>'' - starts the next AI immediately. If <ainame> is given, that AI will load instead of the one set in the ''AI settings'' window. <parameters> configure the behaviour of that AI, it does the same as the ''Configure'' button in the ''AI settings'' window. Example:
 start_ai admiralai use_planes=0,use_trains=1

'''reload_ai <company_slot>''' - deletes the company given in <company_slot>, and then restarts the AI. The ''Reload AI'' button in the [[Main/en/AI Debug window]] does the same.

'''stop_ai <company_slot>''' - stops the AI at the given company slot, and then deletes the company.
