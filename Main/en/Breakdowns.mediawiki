[[Translation:Main/en/Breakdowns]]
[[Main/en/Vehicles|Vehicle]] '''Breakdowns''' occur when a vehicle is in transit. It usually cause a vehicle to stop for a while, causing traffic buildup, but planes will only get a speed reduction which lasts until its speed drops below 6 mph/9 kmh.

How often a vehicle breaks down is directly related to its reliability rating and age. It can be reduced by regular [[Main/en/Servicing|servicing]] of vehicles at a depot or hangar.

In case of road vehicles, a breakdown can trigger the [[Main/en/Disasters|Small UFO Disaster]], where a UFO will crash into a broken-down road vehicle.

Breakdowns can be turned on or off via the [[Main/en/Difficulty|Difficulty window]].
