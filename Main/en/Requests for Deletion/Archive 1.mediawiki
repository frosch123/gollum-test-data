== Constructing airports and aircrafts ==
*[[Main/en/Airport construction|Constructing airports and aircrafts]] - redirect page that had a single link to it. 13:27, 18 Jul 2006 (PDT)
:'''Keep''': '''Comment''': Why delete a redirect page because of only one link? There's nothing wrong with superfluous redirects. [[Archive/en/Ae-a|Ae-a]] 19:17, 19 July 2006 (CEST)
:'''Keep''': Yes. People may search for "aircrafts", no matter how many links. [[Archive/en/Born Acorn|Born Acorn]] 19:40, 19 July 2006 (CEST)
:'''Comment''': I suggested it because I removed (fixed) the ''only'' link to it ("aircrafts" isn't English).  The single-word "Aircrafts" link should stay, no question; people will search for that.  This one?  Color me dubious.  But I'm new here, it doesn't cost anything to keep it, and I did it because I'm still learning wikiness and punching merely seemingly-relevant buttons, so I'll gladly defer.  Yank this either way I guess. --[[Archive/en/71.109.84.110|71.109.84.110]] 22:15, 19 July 2006 (CEST)
:'''Delete''': It is only there as the page was moved to [[Main/en/Airport construction|Constructing airports and aircraft]], source - [http://wiki.openttd.com/index.php?title=Constructing_airports_and_aircrafts&action=history history] -- [[Archive/en/Bruce98|Bruce98]] 14:44, 21 July 2006 (CEST)
:: '''Comment''': A redirect in terms of size is insignificant compared to the size of the Wiki database. The idea behind the redirect is that it should redirect from the bad English title to the good English title. Also, anyone who'se bookmarked this page may not so easily be able to find it if the redirect is deleted. And besides, over on Wikipedia, they have a category for redirects from mis-spellings.
:: '''Comment''':The fact it is only there as the page was moved may be an even stronger reason to keep. People may make the same mistake in English while editing pages, or may still type that in a URL. [[Archive/en/Born Acorn|Born Acorn]] 21:58, 21 July 2006 (CEST)

'''Comment''': If it's a static IP, and he plans to do more from that IP, he can personalise it to his hearts content. If it's never used to contribute ever again, '''delete''' it.

I left Blathijs, MYOB and Tokai just because someone linked to them. Voice your opinions, I'm with removing these. If any of developers mentioned before wants to have his page, let him do so, but page must be User:Name, not just a Name. If you agree, I'll change linkings to these pages and remove the pages.
