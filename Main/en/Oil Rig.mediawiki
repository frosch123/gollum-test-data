The '''Oil Rig''' produces [[Main/en/Oil]] and [[Main/en/Passengers]]; it also accepts Passengers and [[Main/en/Mail]] as cargo. Being the only industry (not counting game-changing [[Main/en/NewGRF|NewGRFs]]) that is constructed entirely on water, it is also ''only'' found in the temperate climate. Rigs don't appear until year 1960.

Another specialty about the Oil Rig is that it is a neutral station complete with built-in [[Main/en/Water Transport Tiles|dock]] for [[Main/en/Ships|ships]] and helipad for [[Main/en/Aircraft|helicopters]]. Every [[Main/en/Transport company|company]] can transport to and from these facilities as soon as its construction is finished.

Note that some servers running the latest versions of OpenTTD only allow cargo to be transported to or from Oil Rigs via their own neutral stations and nothing else. This means that eventually you '''will''' have to use ships to transport oil.

If one company transfers cargo to a rig's neutral station, a second company may pick up the cargo. This causes the first company to lose the payment for the cargo, because the entire payment goes to the company that makes the final delivery.
