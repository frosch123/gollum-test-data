'''NewStations''' is a large [[Main/en/NewGRF]] set created by [[Main/en/Michael Blunck]]. It features many types of stations, mostly passenger. A freight version is under development.

NewStations is the most popular station set, as it is so well drawn.

It was released in stages. First came a set of NewGRF Waypoints, followed by passenger stations. It's anticipated that Michael Blunck will release the freight stations in the future. Michael has released several "teaser" screenshots of these freight stations, and they are said to be animated. [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=486481#486481 [1<nowiki>]</nowiki>]
