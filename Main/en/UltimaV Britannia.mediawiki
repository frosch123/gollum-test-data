|description=The world of Britannia of Ultima V. 24 towns with all the industries are distributed in realistic geographical regions. Special effects include Lord British's Castle, flood plains along the Lost River, canals of Trinsic, assorted swamps, the tree-top city of Yew, the deserted Drylands and the precarious existence of New Magincia!

Note: There are no trains for the first 10 years to encourage road and sea transport. If you prefer trains, change the year to 1945 in the scenario editor (or cheat window).
