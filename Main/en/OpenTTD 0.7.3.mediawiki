==Changelog==

===0.7.3 (2009-10-01)===

* Fix: [NewGRF] Crash when trying to build an industry that has no industry layout defined {{en/Flyspray|3233}} (r17638, r17633)

===0.7.3-RC2 (2009-09-24)===

* Update: Documentation about bug reporting and known bugs (r17554)
* Fix: When a command did not fail in test run and failed in execution run, error message was not set. Affects only few commands (r17607)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Crash when defining the same tile in a tile layout twice {{en/Flyspray|3218}} (r17605)
* Fix: Vehicle image was not always updated when needed (r17594)
* Fix: [NoAI] Could not query the size of small airports when they could not be build anymore {{en/Flyspray|3212}} (r17591)
* Fix: Erroneous message about changing the difficulty level {{en/Flyspray|3220}} (r17588)
* Fix: Assertion triggered when the second vehicle in a 101+ (or 11+ if mammoth trains is disabled) vehicle free wagon chain is an engine and the first vehicle is moved to another chain {{en/Flyspray|3208}} (r17576)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Memory leak when viewing the NewGRF settings of a server (r17563)

* Fix: [NoAI] Crash when doing commands in the "global" scope {{en/Flyspray|3202}} (r17544)

* Change: [Unix] Only use colorized error output on interactive terminals (r17227)
