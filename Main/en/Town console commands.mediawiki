Identifier is used to specify on which industry the command will be applied.
Identifier can be:
{|
| '''all''' or '''*''' || for all towns
|-
| '''statue'''         || for towns where you have statue built
|-
| '''no_statue'''      || for towns where you do not have statue built
|-
| ''name of town'' or ''ID of town'' || for specific town
|}
Operators '''&lt;''', '''&gt;''', '''&lt;=''', '''&gt;=''' and '''&lt;&gt;''' can be used instead of '''=''' for following matches:
{|
| '''any_exclusive='''[value] ||  for matching months of remaining exclusive rights for any company
|-
| '''currnoise='''[value] ||  for matching currently used noise level
|-
| '''exclusive='''[value] ||  for matching company having exclusive rights

|-
| '''roadworks='''[value] ||  for matching months remaining in road reconstructions

|}

You can specify multiple match conditions before the command.
If you use more than one match condition, you have to separate them by 'and' or '&' parameter. Number of match conditions is not limited.
