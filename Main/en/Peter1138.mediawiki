== TODO ==

Stuff which is necessary

* Give the mini-map window some attention. It is horrible with many cargoes or industries available.

Stuff to add

* Freeform docks, probably already patches available for this
* Related engines, grouping of engines to expose related models or liveries in a user friendly manner (not cargo subtypes!)
* [[Main/en/Peter1138/RoadLanes]]

== Stuff ==

* Korenn's [[Main/en/Peter1138/Towngrowth Challenge]] (OCS)
* VarAction2able [[Main/en/Peter1138/NewBridges|bridges]] some day?
* NewGRF controlled [[Main/en/Peter1138/Railtypes|rail types]] and [[Main/en/Peter1138/Roadtypes|road types]] perhaps...
* NewGardens
* More bullet points

Test

''I'm waiting my visitation from the men in black. Are they grey or is it my own nation?''
