=== The availability of trains in different game periods. With which year you can start to play in a set. The choice of rolling stock at the beginning of the game===
In the set you can start to play since 1871 (the year of the advent of the steam locomotive F (Ferly's system)). But not all goods can be transported in this year: 
*In a temperate climate with a standard industries - oil
*In the subarctic climate with the standard industries - oil and products
*In a tropical climate with a standard industries - oil, products and fruits
List of appearance of the first cars for the transport of cargoes with standard industries:

Based on the table, we can draw the following conclusions:
*If the player is interested to know the years of the appearance of all RS, then you can start the game in 1871 (the year of the advent of the steam locomotive F (Ferly's system))
*If a player wants to transport all available standard cargos, then the game should start in 1895. Moreover, the list of available cargoes depends on the type of climate (see the table above)
When connecting sets of additional graphics (for example, ECS, FIRS) the list of goods transported will be different from the standard. <br>
The first RS is avaible in 1871 year - steam F (Ferly's system). In the following years will different types of other RS - locomotives, electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, DMUs and EMUs. <br>
Selection of RS depends on the start date of the game. Examples will be given with the parameter set - the select list of RS series: normal. Read more about the options set out in section [[Main/en/XUSSR Set/The parameters of the xUSSR set|'''The parameters of the xUSSR set.''']] <br>
