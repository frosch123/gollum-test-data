|description=This 512x512 temperate scenario models the Mandelbrot set as a sea surrounded by cliffs and capes, with an island in the form of a Julia set.

Most towns (named after some mathematicians associated with fractals) line the coast, while industries are found in the surrounding forests, except for oil which abounds in the Mandlebrot Sea.

The scenario is rather easy, except for building the gorge and twin Sierpinski-carpet towns!
