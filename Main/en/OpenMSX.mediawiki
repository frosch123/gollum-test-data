== About OpenMSX ==

OpenMSX is an open source music base set for OpenTTD which can completely replace the TTD base set. The main goal of OpenMSX therefore is to provide a set of free base music files which make it possible to play OpenTTD without requiring the (copyrighted) files from the TTD CD. This potentially increases the OpenTTD fanbase and makes it a true free game (with "free" as in both "[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/free beer free beer]" and "[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/free speech free speech]"). As of version 0.3.0 a complete set of 31 MIDI files is available.

The secondary goal of the project is to include music which matches the style and spirit of the original TTD music. The original music, composed by John Broomhall of MicroProse, is described as "old-style blues and jazz" inspired by Herbie Hancock's "Cantaloupe Island" musical composition standard. While it is not possible to replace every piece of music with a direct clone, the project does aim to provide as many blues- and jazz-style pieces that seem to exemplify the spirit of the original music. With that said, contributions in styles other than blues and jazz will will also be considered. 

A third goal of the project is to have as much original contribution from the OpenTTD community as possible. Such contributions may be small in number due to the fact that most members of the community are not musicians, nor most of them able to create music in the MIDI file format. Due to this fact, music solicited from contributors outside of the OpenTTD community will be substituted in order to create a full pack of music. As new, original contributions from the OpenTTD community are submitted, they will replace the contributions of those outside of the community. 

Once there is a complete pack of original music from the community, expansion packs may be developed with more contributors from within and without the OpenTTD community, along with a wider variety of styles.

== Downloading OpenMSX ==

OpenTTD nightly release r19259, or stable release 1.0.0 or higher is required for installation. The easiest way to install OpenMSX is through the Online Content Service, BaNaNaS. If you are performing a new installation for the first time, you can select the latest version of OpenMSX from the installation menu. If you have an existing OpenTTD installation, then click on the "Check Online Content" button from the main menu and select OpenMSX, then click the "Game Options" button from the main menu and select OpenMSX from the "Base music set" pull-down menu. 

If you wish to install the files manually, the latest version can be downloaded from the file repository at [http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/openmsx/releases/]. The files should be unpacked in the '''/gm''' directory where you installed the game. Further instructions on installation can be found in Section 1 of the [http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/openmsx/releases/LATEST/readme.txt readme.txt] file.
