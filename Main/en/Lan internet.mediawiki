[[Translation:Main/en/Lan internet]]
This setting specifies whether you are running a LAN- or Internet-visible game server. An Internet-visible game will be advertised on the master server browser, allowing online players to join your game easily. Note that, even if you set the game to LAN-only, online players will still be able to join if it is possible to reach [[Main/en/Server port|server_port]] from the Internet, by adding it manually to their personal server lists.

The setting of lan_internet can be set to:
* '''0''' = internet-visible, advertised on master server list
* '''1''' = LAN-only, not advertised.

Note that the setting [[Main/en/Server advertise|server_advertise]] also affects advertising to the master server list.
