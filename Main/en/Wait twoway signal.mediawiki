[[Translation:Main/en/Wait twoway signal]]
{{en/-}}
This setting controls the wait-time in seconds for two-way [[Main/en/signals]]. After this time-out, trains will turn around to see if there is an alternative route (this behavior can be disabled).

The possible values are between 2 and 255. A value of 255 is special, as it indicates that a train will wait forever at the signal without turning.
