|Description=The Manley-Morel DMU is a Diesel Multiple unit that by default comes with two units and carries passengers.

These trains are really only suitable for light passenger transport, as they lack the power to transport heavier goods and pull more carriages.  You could add more units to increase the power and capacity (in true DMU style), but you are still limited to 70mph, so a better option would be to wait for the [[Main/en/SH "125"]] to become available in 1977 and use that.  

A word of warning though, when faster trains arrive on a large network, you may find that they get stuck behind these slower units slowing the whole network down, so you should either upgrade the whole lot, keep the DMUs on a separate section of track, or build [[Main/en/overtaking sections]].

This train is made obsolete by the [[Main/en/Dash|"Dash"]] which is introduced in 1984, 5mph faster and 100hp more powerful - doesn't sound like much, but you'd be surprised how quickly they take off!

|Real-life=This is the Transport Tycoon version of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BR_Class_101 Metro-Cammell Class 101 DMU] which was introduced as part of the 1956 British Railways Modernisation Plan, designed to replace steam locomotives on local and semi-express lines.  It is representative of the general style of DMUs introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Unbelievably, despite the TTD '12 year' life span, these machines were still seen plodding around the British countryside as late as 2003! They still operate on preserved railway lines.
