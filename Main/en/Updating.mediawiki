Keeping your programs up to date is always a good idea. Security vulnerabilities are unlikely to be exploited in OpenTTD but still, [http://security.openttd.org/en some exist]. Also, new versions of OpenTTD include [[Main/en/bugfix]]es and new features, almost all people play on [[Main/en/multiplayer]] using latest stable version and using outdated versions is not recommended. Also online content like [[Main/en/NewGRF]]s, [[Main/en/AI]]s should be updated.

It is a good idea to update on encountering some problems, it is likely that it is fixed in recent version (if bug is present also after update - please report it).
