====Join train stations built next to each other====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Stations built next to each other will be [[Main/en/join train stations|joined]] as long as the station spread is not too high.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (join_stations = <true|false>)

====Leave station when any cargo is full, if ‘full load’====
{{en/Feature|-0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0 to 0.6.3)}}
When this patch is enabled the vehicle will leave when [[Main/en/full load any cargo|any cargo is fully loaded]]. If you use lots of planes to transport passengers and mail you may want to disable this patch.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (full_load_any = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}
====Use improved loading algorithm====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.5)}}
An [[Main/en/Improved Loading|improved loading algorithm]] (which load only one vehicle and only after it is full and ready to go start loading next), as opposed to the old balanced loading algorithm.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (improved_load = <true|false>)

====Deliver cargo to a station only when there is demand====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Cargo will only be generated at a station when a vehicle with the [[Main/en/select goods|capacity to pick that cargo up]] has visited the station.  Affects station ratings.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (selectgoods = <true|false>)

====TTDPatch compatible nonstop handling====
{{en/Feature|-0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0 to 0.6.3)}}
[[Main/en/new nonstop handling|Non stop handling]] similar to that of TTDPatch.
When this option is enabled, trains don't stop except where ordered (there's an implied non-stop on every "go to...") and an explicit non-stop order allows a train to use a station as a waypoint, without stopping.  See [http://wiki.ttdpatch.net/tiki-index.php?page=NewNonstopHandling TTDPatch NewNonstopHandling page] for more information.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

====Non uniform stations====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.0)}}
Enables you to [[Main/en/nonuniform stations|join stations together at different angles]], so you can have two vertical tracks and three horizontal tracks.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (nonuniform_stations = <true|false>)

====Max station spread====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.2)}}
How [[Main/en/change station spread|spread out a station can be]] from one end to the other.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#FF7E00">'''4'''</span> to <span style="color:#FF7E00">'''64'''</span> <span style="color:red">(Warning: High setting slows game)</span>

====Service helicopters at helipads====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.3)}}
Helicopters will be [[Main/en/service at helipad|serviced at helipads]] so they don’t need an airport in their orders, but you need to build helicopters from airport. This is moved to [[Main/en/Advanced Settings/Vehicles#Service helicopters at helipads automatically|Vehicles section]] since 0.7.0.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (service_at_helipad = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}
====Allow more realistically sized catchment areas====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.5)}}
Changes the [[Main/en/catchment]] areas to be more [[Main/en/modified catchment|realistically sized]].
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (modified_catchment = <true|false>)

====Load vehicles gradually====
{{en/Feature|0.5|align="right"|text=(since 0.5.0)}}
Vehicles will load cargo over a period of time, not full load instantly. If the option to show loading arrows is switched on, this will be reflected correctly.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (gradual_loading = <true|false>)

==== Allow drive-through road stops on town owned roads ====
{{en/Feature period|0.6|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0 to 0.6.3)}}
It will be possible to build [[Main/en/Drive-through Road Stops|drive-through road stops]] on [[Main/en/town]] owned roads.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (road_stop_on_town_road = <true|false>)

==== Allow building adjacent stations ====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Using CTRL, while building [[Main/en/station]] directly adjacent to one another will form new station.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
