'''NewGRF Houses''', known colloquially as '''Newhouses''', is a [[Main/en/NewGRF]] feature for [[Main/en/OpenTTD]] that allows support of GRF files which use this feature. Newhouses is far more advanced than simple image replacement, as it also changes buildings statistics. 

==History==
Before the advent of newhouses, GRF authors could only replace existing graphics to create new buildings. Now, however, new buildings can be added as well as replacements, allowing for a much more diverse look to towns and cities.

The original feature was created by Csaboka for [[Main/en/TTDPatch]] and by a number of developers, including [[Main/en/Maedhros]], [[Main/en/Belugas]] and [[Main/en/peter1138]] for OpenTTD.

==GRF Sets==
Currently there are few Newhouses sets available, the most notable being the [[Main/en/Total Town Replacement Set]] by Zimmlock. There are also several known to be in development, such as [[Main/en/PikkaBird|PikkaBird's]] Urban Renewal, and [[Main/en/Michael Blunck|Michael Blunck's]] Diversa.
