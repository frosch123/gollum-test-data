[[Translation:Main/en/Right-of-way Roundabout]]
{{en/-}}{{junctionsmenu}}
The '''Right-of-way Roundabout''' is a combination of the [[Main/en/Building depots#Advanced depot configurations]] and [[Main/en/Roundabout]] designs.  It uses [[Main/en/pre-signals]] to give priority to trains traveling on the main lines.  The lowered areas of this junction create a roundabout large enough to hold four 10-car trains. Trains moving from the mainlines to the roundabout do so after passing through a long branch, so trains waiting to move onto the roundabout do not block the main line. Trains turning right have room to stop and not block the mainline if interrupted by a train exiting the roundabout.

The picture shows how trains traveling straight through the junction receive preferential treatment, and how merging trains need to wait until the main line is clear.

{{Template:Junction_Criteria|Expensive|4|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|2||Broken down trains affect one line or all left turns.|
*Very high capacity.
*Traffic jams unlikely but possible (left turns).
*Trains can use the junction to make a U-turn.
*Requires a large area, 22 x 22. (220 extra square tiles used)
*Maximum signal distance: 8
*Minimum tiles between double bend: 1 (diagonal)
