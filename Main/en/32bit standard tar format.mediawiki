{{historic|'''The method of loading 32bpp graphics changed in OpenTTD 1.2.0. The content on this page does not apply to OpenTTD 1.2.0 or newer.'''}}
It is advisable that all [[Main/en/32bit Graphics Development|32bit graphics]] are released in a standard format. This is to ensure compatibility between different kinds of OpenTTD installations, and ease of manual organising and file management, and automatic distribution.

==Tar layout==

A tar is supposed to have the following layout.

<pre>
readme.txt              [author information, license, etc.]
sources/                [blend files, materials, photos, rendering instructions, etc.]
sprites/
sprites/ogfx1_base/     [main sprite set]
sprites/ogfxc_arctic/   [sub-arctic sprites]
sprites/ogfxh_tropical/ [sub-tropical sprites]
sprites/ogfxi_logos/    [logos & graphics]
sprites/ogfxt_toyland/  [toyland sprites]
sprites/trg1            [symlink to ogfx1_base]
sprites/trg1r           [symlink to ogfx1_base]
sprites/trgc            [symlink to ogfxc_arctic]
sprites/trgcr           [symlink to ogfxc_arctic]
sprites/trgh            [symlink to ogfxh_tropical]
sprites/trghr           [symlink to ogfxh_tropical]
sprites/trgi            [symlink to ogfxi_logos]
sprites/trgir           [symlink to ogfxi_logos]
sprites/trgt            [symlink to ogfxt_toyland]

Sources will be omitted in packages aimed at players, but they are still needed to fulfil GPL rules.
