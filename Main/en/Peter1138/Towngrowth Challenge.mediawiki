This is the project page for the Towngrowth Challenge, based on the [[http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=16072 Openttd Challenge Spinoff]] by Korenn. Hopefully, this project will allow the gameplay to be viable for trunk inclusion.

==Towngrowth Challenge (TC) gameplay goals:==

Each game started with TC has a population goal set, which can be defined at the beginning of the game and is immutable once the game has started. Once a company's claimed population reaches the population goal, that company wins the game. After the game is won, play can continue in the normal fashion but without scoring (like in regular ttd). The normal ttd game rules still count, so construction still costs money and a company losing too much money will go bankrupt.

additional rules and definitions:
* the claimed population of a company is the sum of the population of all towns claimed by that company
* a town is claimed by the company that delivered the highest amount of cargo units to it. The cargo that counts towards this are passengers, mail, water, food, goods and valuables

With these rules the challenge becomes to make the towns you have claimed grow. But other than in normal ttd, the towns do not grow unless their demands are met.
 
TC introduces 7 classifications for towns:
The cargo deliveries mentioned are on a per month basis.
 
{|
|-
| community||
* A small settlement of up to 300 inhabitants. 
* Communities demand either passengers or mail delivered to grow. 
* When a community is smaller than 150, it will grow on its own to make sure passenger transport is possible.
|-
| village||
* A village has 300 up to 600 inhabitants.
* Villages require both passengers and mail delivered to grow.
|-
| township||
* Townships are villages on the edge of becoming a town, they have from 600 up to a 1000 inhabitants.
* Townships require a larger amount of passengers and mail delivered, plus either a supply of water or food before they'll grow
|-
| town||
* Towns are small larger concentrations of people of 1000 to 3000 inhabitants.
* Towns require even more passengers and mail, plus both food and water to grow.
|-
| city||
* A city can have from 3000 up to 6000 inhabitants.
* Cities require large amounts of passengeers and mail, larger amounts of food and water, and either goods or valuables to grow.
|-
| metropolis||
* A metropolis is a thriving hub of civilization with a minimum of 6000 and a maximum of 15000 inhabitants.
* A metropolis requires all cargo: large amounts of passengers and mail, serious amounts of food and water and both goods and valuables before it will grow.
|-
| capital||
* A capital is the largest size a town can be in TC. 
* It allows for a small amount of growth under the same requirements as a metropolis up to 15500 inhabitants, to avoid a town bouncing between metropolis and capital.
* Once at or over 15500 inhabitants, it can no longer grow.
|-
|}

Towns track how many units of cargo they have received from all companies since start of game. The company with the highest amount has claim of the town and its population counts towards this company's population total.
Cargo supplied to a power station belonging to a town counts as power for the town. A town with sufficient power (power demand depends on town size) grows 4 times faster than a town without power.

==Cargo and industries==
there are 3 types of industries in TC, internally classified as primary, secondary and tertiary industries.

* Primary industries produce raw materials. These are the mines, plantations, etc.

* Secondary industries process materials into cargo. Sometimes the resulting cargo requires more processing at another secondary industry. These are the factories and refineries.

* Tertiary industries accept cargo. These industries service the towns, they are the water tower, banks, shopping mall and power station.

Only secondary industries can be funded (in fact, they will not start on their own). Tertiary industries can be funded through the town authorities, who will then decide on their own where to build that industry.

Only primary industries start as new random industries during the game.

Oilwells act like other primary industries, so they do not forcibly close down.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> For compatibility this is in Steel's cargo slot.
<nowiki>**</nowiki> Metals use the steel cargo graphics.
<nowiki>***</nowiki> Chemicals use the oil cargo graphics.

Toys do not provide any function other than to create an easy type of cargo to earn some money with by transporting it from a factory to a shopping mall, which can be invaluable while setting up a large distribution network. ''To lessen code impact, Toys and Rubber were scrapped.''

=Required Programming Changes=

The goal with these changes is to do them in modules, and try and make them as minimally invasive as possible. 
Module definitions so far:
* Town classification
* Town growth
* Town claiming
* Scoring
* Finish industries

==Town classification==
Display a classification for the town, depending on its size ''Could be done even for normal games?''
* add strings for classifications
 a) "Community of {TOWN}"
 b) "Village of {TOWN}"
 c) "Township of {TOWN}"
 d) "Town of {TOWN}"
 e) "City of {TOWN}"
 f) "Metropolis of {TOWN}"
 g) "Capitol of {TOWN}"
* update town gui title bar
 if size < 300 display (a)
 if size >= 300 && size < 600 display (b)
 if size >= 600 && size < 1000 display (c)
 if size >= 1000 && size < 3000 display (d)
 if size >= 3000 && size < 6000 display (e)
 if size >= 6000 && size < 15000 display (f)
 if size >= 15000 display (g)


==Town growth==
Make growth of towns depend on the cargo delivered as described above.<br>
''Question:''<br>
Should this be made generic? allowing all cargos to potentially influence town growth, and setting demands through a newgrf interface? It would require some sort of newtown construction, with appropriate properties and callbacks.<br>
<br>
''Note:'' This module will bump the savegame version for TC, due to storing of delivered cargo last month and this month for each town.<br>
<br>
* store town cargo delivered
 cargo delivered is added to its slot in Town
 at end of month, this data is saved in the corresponding cargo_last_month slots
* town growth depending on cargo delivered
 compare cargo_last_month with demands defined by current town class. if sufficient -> town grows
 when allowed, towns grow significantly faster than in vanilla ottd
<br>
* water provided to a water tower counts as water supplied to the town ''normal TTD behaviour''
* food provided to a shopping mall counts as food supplied to the town (in addition to buildings) ''normal TTD behaviour''
* goods provided to a shopping mall counts as goods supplied to the town
* valuables provided to a shopping mall or bank counts as valuables supplied to the town
* do not accept passengers or mail originating from the same town

===Town gui===
below normal cargo supply text, show amount of cargo delivered to this town last month. Highlight in red any amount that is insufficient for town growth. Highlight in yellow any amount that is sufficient for growth.<br>
If made generic, entries should be automatically generated depending on the cargos that influence town growth

==Town claiming==
Changes to allow a company to claim a town.<br>
<br>
''Note:'' This module will bump the savegame version for TC, due to storing of cargo delivery and claimant ID for each town

===Town logic===
 Add a claimant variable; current town claimant
 Add an integer entry for each possible company: holds received amount of cargo
 When a company exceeds the current claimants amount of received cargo, they become the new claimant

===World gui===
* print town names in company color of claiming company. non-claimed towns in gray 
 Create a translation table from company color to string color
 print town name with string "{COLOR}{TOWN}", with parameter color: ColorTranslation(GetCompanyColor(Town->claimant))
 
''Or add a company colour marker?'' ''What about a company-colored flag before town name?''
 draw company icon before town string
Advantage of this approach: works together with other town-string changing patches.
Disadvantage: more code changes required.

===Town gui===
show company logo and name of claiming company

===Town directory gui===
show town names in claimed colors (and gray for unclaimed)

===News ticker gui===
add town claiming messages (with own category)
 Add a category for Town claiming messages
 Add string: "{TOWN} was claimed by {COMPANY}"
 When town claimant changes, generate new message

Add claimed town status messages (same category as above) ''may need 2 categories: own town and opponent town'' <br>
The message will only be displayed on growth, to reduce amount of bouncing messages, but can be shown multiple times, to void having to store message status.
 Add string: "{TOWN} has grown to the status of Village!"  ''could introduce new variable {TOWNCLASS}''
 Add string: "{TOWN} has grown to the status of Township!"
 Add string: "{TOWN} has grown to the status of Town!"
 Add string: "{TOWN} has grown to the status of City!"
 Add string: "{TOWN} has grown to the status of Metropolis!"
 Add string: "{TOWN} has grown to the status of Capital!"
 When town grows to new status, generate relevant message

===Map gui===
color claimed towns in company color in town view

==Scoring==
This module takes the changes from the previous modules and gives feedback to the players. Graphs for population, information about the goal, a screen to display when someone has won the challenge.<br>
<br>
''Note:'' This module will bump the savegame version for TC, due to storing of graph data.

===World Logic===
* check for winning conditions and if they are met do game won stuff (in the montly loop)

===Player company gui===
* add line displaying total claimed population
* add line displaying total number of claimed towns

===(new) goal gui===
* short explanation of goal
* show population goal for game win
* show current claimed population
* show 'top X' list, that shows each company with their claimed population, sorted to claimed population

===(new) population graph===
* identical layout to standard company value graph
* first option in the list is World Population (black?) ''Could be done for normal games as well?''
* on the y axis, instead of company value, show claimed population ''Why not both?'' - ''this is an additional graph, not a replacement''
* data points have to be stored for companies and world population

===(new) game win gui===
* show player company name, player name and portrait of winner
* show amount of days played since game start
* show amount of cargo transported
* store game over state, so that this window does not pop up again

==Finish industries==
In this final module, the last grf changes should be made for houses, and optionally the power station could be introduced (power station will bump savegame version, because amount of ''power'' needs to be stored for last month and this month).

* disallow building of statues and fountains in towns, those drop population ''newhouses''
* disallow building of shopping mall, it is now an industry ''newhouses''
* add food acceptance to buildings (in addition to other acceptance) ''newhouses''
* Optionally: cargo supplied to a power station supplies ''power'' to the town, instead of cargo. a town supplied with power grows four times faster than one that is not.

===Town authority gui===
* add 3 options: Fund water tower (cheap), Fund shopping mall (moderately expensive), Fund power station (expensive)
* funding those buildings is not possible if that building already exists for this town
