[[Translation:Main/en/Disable inflation]]
A [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] that completely disables [[Main/en/Inflation|inflation]], meaning all prices will stay constant throughout the game.


== Description ==
All prices stay constant throughout the whole game with this patch. This way you can easily see how much more profit you are making compared to the recent years.


== Use ==
[[Main/en/Inflation]] is enabled by default. You can disable it through the [[Main/en/Configuring patches/Economy|configure patches -> economy]] window (versions prior to 0.7.0) or use the following syntax in [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg|openttd.cfg]]:
