[[Translation:Main/en/Bribe authority]]
A [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] that allows you to bribe local authorities.

== Description ==
When you enable this option is added to the [[Main/en/Local authority|local authority]] window allowing you to bribe the local authority in attempt to raise your company rating in that locality. Bribe with caution, however, as many transport companies have been caught out by the [[Main/en/Regional Investigator]]s who look very poorly upon this behaviour. {{en/Note|You can not bribe local authorities to raise your company rating above 'Excellent'}}

== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. Disable the ''Allow bribing of the local authority'' in [[Main/en/Advanced Settings/Economy#Allow bribing of the local authority|Advanced Settings/Economy]] window or use the following syntax in [[Main/en/Openttd.cfg|openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[economy]
bribe = false</pre>

== Penalty ==
If you get caught, your local authority rating will instantly drop to Poor, your station ratings will instantly drop to 0, and you won't be able to use the actions on the local authority where you got caught for six months.
