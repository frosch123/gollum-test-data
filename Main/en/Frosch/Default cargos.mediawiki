== Introduction ==

There are a number of built-in cargo definition in OpenTTD and TTDPatch.
These definitions include which cargo classes the cargos belong to.
Changing these classes is not possible, as it would break all vehicle GRFs which have to rely on them. (This isn't even possible when bumping the GRF version.)

However, this restriction does apply to adding new cargo classes, which were undefined before. Old GRFs will not break because they do not use the new classes; and new GRFs can check the version of OpenTTD/TTDPatch whether they already provide the new classes.

Recently these new classes were defined:
* Neo-bulk 
* Clean

Somewhat older, but afaik not used in released sets are these classes:
* Hazardous
* Covered / sheltered
* Oversized and / or overweight

See [http://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action0/Cargos#CargoClasses_.2816.29 the specs] for the meaning of the classes.
