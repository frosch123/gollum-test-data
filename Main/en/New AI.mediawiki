{{en/Warning|The New AI in OpenTTD is DEAD. It is no longer on active development. If you want to pick it up again, feel free and have a look at [[Main/en/AI:Main Page|AI:Main_Page]]. Note, however, that NoAI branch is active, and is developing new OpenTTD AIs using Squirrel.}}


This information pertains to work done on the now-deprecated 'New AI', which has largely been replaced by '[[Main/en/AI:Main Page|NoAI]]' for the purpose of ongoing development. 

New AI plans:

- [[Main/en/New AI/Airport|New AI / Airport]] Airport

- [[Main/en/New AI/Trains|New AI / Trains]] Trains .... what about trains?
