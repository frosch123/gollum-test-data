__TOC__

'''Build on slopes''' is a patch which allows almost any of your infrastructure to be built on slopes where the height difference would be only one. This is an implementation of retaining walls seen in real life.

== Description ==
Normally the options available of building on slopes (sides of mountains, coasts, or smaller bumps, holes in the ground) is very limited. You can only build parallel to the slope, any other direction is prohibited.

With this patch you will have a lot more options for building on slopes:
*Roads can be built perpendicular to the hillside/coast.
*Tracks can be built in any direction on a hillside/coast, except for parts that would have their ending on the lower edge of the foundation
*Road railway depots as well as bus and truck loading bays can be built in any direction, except facing downhill
*Railway stations can be built perpendicular to a hillside/coast.
*Airports, heliports, Company Headquarters, lighthouses and transmitters (scenario editor) can be built on any slope as long as there is a maximum of 1 heightlevel difference
*All roads, tracks, stations can be built over small "holes" in the ground (maximum 1 level deep)
*Bridges can also be built anywhere as long as the beginning and ending are on the same level or 1 higher/lower.

Since currently the AI is unable to properly make use of this feature, it is disabled for the computer player.

A nice side-effect of this patch is that you are now able to build stations spanning across different height levels. Just place the station platforms seperately, height-level by height-level. You might need to turn on [[Main/en/nonuniform stations]] to enjoy the full effect of this patch.

==Steeper Slopes==
Since '''r5864''' (OpenTTD 0.5.0) it has been possible to build on slopes that are entirely sloped. Track can be built up and down them, and along to top or bottom, but not both.

== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. You can disable this advanced setting through the [[Main/en/Advanced Settings/Construction#Allow building on slopes and coasts|construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[Main/en/openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>
[construction]
build_on_slopes = false
