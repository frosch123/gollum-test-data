The '''Food Processing Plant''' is responsible for producing [[Main/en/Food]]. In [[Main/en/Climates#Sub-arctic|sub-arctic climates]] it needs [[Main/en/Livestock]] and [[Main/en/Wheat]], in [[Main/en/Climates#Sub-tropical|sub-tropic climates]] it is best to deliver both [[Main/en/Fruit]] and [[Main/en/Maize]].

Food from the plant is required in both climates to grow [[Main/en/Towns]] beyond their initial size, though only towns above the snow-line (sub-arctic) or in deserts (sub-tropical) are affected. The latter ones also want additional [[Main/en/Water]] for growth.
