'''Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set''' or '''GRVTS''' is a [[Main/en/newGRF|newgrf]] vehicle set by [[Archive/en/Zephyris|Zephyris]]. GRVTS provides road vehicles and [[Main/en/trams]] for all [[Main/en/climate]]s in dual [[Main/en/company colours]], with articulated vehicles. This set uses [[Main/en/refit]]ting and generic cargo classes, so may be used with any [[Main/en/NewGRF Industries|new industry set]] (although some cargos may use generic graphics).

An extended version of GRVTS, [[Main/en/eGRVTS]], also exists which includes many additional vehicles.
