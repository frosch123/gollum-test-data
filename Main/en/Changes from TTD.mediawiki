[[Translation:Main/en/Changes from TTD]]
=What's in OpenTTD that wasn't in the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe?=

OpenTTD is modeled after the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch] while others are original. You have also here a [[Main/en/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features]].

==Significant enhancements==

* Multiple ports - A native Linux version, Windows, Mac OS X, OS/2 and more.
* [[Main/en/Autorail|Autorail build tool]] - Lets you drag and drop rail in any direction and the computer will build the tracks in that direction for you.
* Bigger maps, up to 4096x4096.
* Realistic scenarios based on heightmaps using digital elevation data downloaded from Google Earth, the forum page http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=27052  or an up-to date word doc http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=92633 .
* [[Main/en/Water Transport Tiles|Canals/Locks]] - Allowing players to create waterways which stretch over the land and have ships navigate them.
* Larger stations - Stations can be longer, consisting of many more platforms.
* [[Main/en/Nonuniform stations|Non-uniform stations]] - Stations can be built slightly offset.
* Ability to [[Main/en/Join train stations|join stations]] (of same width or length) - Building a station next to another station of the same type, width and lengths creates a single longer station.
