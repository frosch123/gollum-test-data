This page will show you how to copy the required GRF files from your CD to the 'data' folder required for OpenTTD to run.

==Windows==
* Insert the CD into the drive, and go to 'My Computer'
* Open the D: drive (Or your CD drive if it isn't D:)
* Press [Ctrl] + [F] on your keyboard, and type '*.grf'
* Click 'Find'
* Select all the files it found, and click 'Copy'
* Now open up C:/Program Files/OpenTTD/data/ , Right-click and choose 'Paste'
* Close all windows except the CD Drive

* Press [Ctrl] + [F] on your keyboard, and type '*.cat'
* Click 'Find'
* Select all the files it found, and click 'Copy'
* Now open up C:/Program Files/OpenTTD/data/ , Right-click and choose 'Paste'

Now you can run OpenTTD!

==Unix/Linux==
Note: These instructions are based on Ubuntu / Kubuntu (Debian based). You may need to change these depending on your distribution.

'''A Note about Unix/Linux:''' Because Unix/Linux files and folders are Case-Sensitive, you may find that OpenTTD will be affected by Capital Letters. This is what the names should look like:

* sample.cat
* TRG1R.GRF
* TRGCR.GRF
* TRGHR.GRF
* TRGTR.GRF
* TRGIR.GRF
* openttdw.grf
* openttdd.grf
* generictrams_v0.4.grf

===BASH Method===
This method uses the BASH shell to copy the required files. This assumes that you CD Drive is '''/media/cdrom0'''. If you have more than one CD drive, then try substituting '''cdrom0''' for '''cdrom1''', '''cdrom2''', etc.

Open up a shell, and navigate to the CD rom drive
 cd /media/cdrom0
Then take a look at the contents
 dir
You should get a list of all the contents of the CD. Now on the disc I had, the GRF files weren't in a folder. If you need to look in different folders, simply type
 cd <foldername>
then to list the contents
 dir
to get back to the cd
 cd /media/cdrom0


Once you've located the GRF files, you can type
 sudo cp *.grf /usr/share/games/openttd/data/
 sudo cp *.cat /usr/share/games/openttd/data/

This will copy all the required files into the data folder. The password it's asking for will be your password.
press [Ctrl] + [F] on your keyboard, and type '*.grf'
Now try to open up openttd again
 openttd


There you go! All should work!

===GUI Method===
Note: These instructions are for '''Kubuntu''' (Hardy Heron) only. You may need to change these instructions as required for your distribution.

* First open up Dolphin in your home folder (/home/<username>/)
* Then without clicking on any folder/file, go to the right-hand pane and click 'Open as Root'.
* Enter your password, and close the window you opened.
* Once the 'root' window has opened, Click on 'Storage Media' on the left-hand pane, and click on the TTD CD.
* Now in the 'Tools' menu, click 'Filter...' and a bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. Type '*.grf' into it. This will only allow you to see GRF files.
* Now look through the contents of the CD until you find the GRF files (They'll be the only ones you can see).
* Select all the files, right-click and choose 'Copy'.
* '''In the same window''' navigate to /usr/share/games/openttd/data
* Right-click and choose 'Paste x files...'

* Go back to your CD '''in the same window''' and change the bar at the bottom of the screen to say '*.cat'
* Now look through the contents of the CD until you find the cat file (It'lle be the only one you can see).
* Select the file, right-click and choose 'Copy'.
* '''In the same window''' navigate to /usr/share/games/openttd/data
* Right-click and choose 'Paste 1 file...'

* Now close the window, and start OpenTTD!
