Work on the Wii port started March 2009. It will be playable with Wiimote and Nunchuck. Since Wii does not accept home made software natively you have to install the [http://wii-homebrew.com "Homebrew Channel"]. 

This is not an official project! It is made by members of the community.
==Current Alternative==
This project is for creating a proper compatible Wii version of OpenTTD.  Currently, the only way to play OpenTTD on the Wii is to install [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DOSBox_Wii DosBox] and download the [[Main/en/OpenTTD DOS|DOS version of OpenTTD]].
== Features ==
* play OTTD online via wifi or offline on your Wii [Don't know if it will be compatible but we will try]
* create your own maps
* save and load games
== Installation ==
* For now the only installation method will be via Homebrew Channel. More information on this will be published later.

== Controls ==
May change later.
