All message types are listed below. For each type, you can set how to display it:
* 'Off' means do not display this type of message,
* 'Summary' means the message will scroll in the bottom status bar, and
* 'Full' means a news window will pop up.

=== Arrival of first vehicle at player's station ===
E.g. "First train arrives at..." for player's stations

=== Arrival of first vehicle at competitors's station ===
E.g. "First train arrives at..." for competitors's stations
