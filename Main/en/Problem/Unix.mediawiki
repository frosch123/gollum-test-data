[[Translation:Main/en/Problem/Unix]]
This section cover some of the more common errors that occur in the UNIX/Linux version of OTTD.

=Generic Issues (NOT distribution based)=
These issues are ones that are not linked to any specific distribution.

===GRF x Missing===
This most commonly is when you first install the game. To resolve this problem, make sure all the required GRF files are in the 'data' folder. 
These include:
* trg1r.grf
* trgcr.grf
* trghr.grf
* trgir.grf
* trgtr.grf
* sample.cat
from the original TTD disk and
* openttdd.grf
* openttddw.grf
* opntitle.dat
from the OTTD Installation.

On some systems there is no way to tell if these are missing with a message. You can run from a shell and see if any messages appear. Please see [[Main/en/OpenTTD GRF missing error Verbose|here]] for more instructions.

* - On Debian-based systems, this is usually /usr/share/games/openttd/data/
Note: YOU WILL NEED '''ROOT''' PRIVILEGES TO ACCESS THIS FOLDER!! See [[Main/en/Copying GRF to data folder|here]] for instructions.

==Game is Running Slowly==
This could be for a variety of reasons.
===You have a slow computer?===
Well, what can I say? You need a better computer. Try more [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory RAM] or a faster [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor processor]. I believe that OTTD works well with a 1.8&nbsp;GHz processor, 256&nbsp;MB RAM and a 16&nbsp;MB Graphics Card, but it will run better with higher specifiactions.

===You have 'station spread' on a high level===
[[Main/en/Change station spread|Station Spread]] is how many squares apart stations can be from one another. The default is 12, while the max is 64. The higher this number, the slower the game will run.

===You are playing on a large map===
A large map such as 2048x2048 with a lot of [[Main/en/vehicles]], [[Main/en/stations]] and [[Main/en/industries]] will slow the game down. Try playing on a better computer, or play on a smaller map in the future.

===You have programmes running in the background===
The game could be slow as you could have a Virus Checker, a firewall, and much other software running in the background. Try and stop as many processes as possible, using either your distribution's settings window or Control Centre. Alternatively, you could use a BASH shell, Type 
 ps ux
and then
 kill xxxx
where xxxx is the number of the process you want to end.

==News is not appearing==
This is probably because you have set the settings to off. Use the 'Message Settings' tab on the 'News' toolbar to customise what you receive news reports for and also if you want to turn off the sound it makes too. [[File:en/newssettings.png|frame|News Settings Panel]]

==I don't have any music!==
Make sure you have copied the music files from the TTD Disk into the 'gm' folder, NOT the 'data' folder.

* - On Debian-based systems, this is usually /usr/share/games/openttd/gm/
Note: YOU WILL NEED '''ROOT''' PRIVILEGES TO ACCESS THIS FOLDER!! See [[Main/en/Copying GRF to data folder|here]] for instructions.

==The Game's crashed! Help!==
The game could have crashed for many reasons. If you un-paused after adding or removing NewGRFs and it has crashed, tough. For all other reasons, please see [https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues GitHub]. Make sure you keep your savegames, error logs and any files created.
===!Disconnecting Train/Vehicle===
You removed a NewGRF that was in use. I got this once and it wrecked my save. Do not remove NewGRFs in a game.
