[[Translation:Main/en/MagLev]]{{en/-}}{{types of railways}}

'''MagLev''' is the English abbreviation for "magnetic levitation," which is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev existing technology] (though it isn't used worldwide.) This technology allows [[Main/en/train]]s to "levitate" (that is, to hover, or stay in the air) due to repelling [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism magnetic forces]. Because there is literally zero friction between train and its tracks, the train and its cars move very fast. The current world speed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_rail_vehicles#Maglev_trains record] for a manned MagLev train is 581 km/h (361 mph) by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCMaglev SCMaglev MLX01] on December 2, 2003.

The first in-game Maglev train (Lev1 'Leviathan' or Wizzowow Rocketeer) is available in 2021.

The toolbar for building MagLev's is found under the [[File:en/manual html m772c5b23.png]] build railway menu item and is the last to be available to build. These tracks only support MagLev-specific vehicles.

There are four Maglev trains available in Temperate, Sub-Arctic and Tropical climates:

There is only one train in Toyland landscape:

None of the MagLev vehicles in OpenTTD have a real-life relative; they are purely fictional.
