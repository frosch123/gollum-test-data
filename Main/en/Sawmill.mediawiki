The '''Sawmill''' turns [[Main/en/wood]] into [[Main/en/goods]], probably an allude to wood furniture or paper goods.

Although wood is available in all three real-life climates, the '''Sawmill''' is only available in [[Main/en/temperate]]:
* The sub-arctic climate inserted the [[Main/en/paper mill]] and the [[Main/en/paper]] cargo (which somewhat resembles [[Main/en/steel]] in temperate) in the middle, therefore wood is not converted directly into goods there.
* Wood (produced by [[Main/en/Lumber Mill|lumber mills]]) in sub-tropical climate is processed in [[Main/en/factory|factories]].
