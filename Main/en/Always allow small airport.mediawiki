This [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] allows you to build small airports at anytime in the game.

== Description ==
Under normal circumstances, as the game progresses, small airports become grayed out and can no longer be built. This can be a pain if you wish to build an airport but don't have the space for a city airport. If this patch is enabled, you will always be able to build small airports.

== Use ==
This feature is disabled by default. You can enable this patch through the [[Main/en/Advanced Settings/Construction#Always allow small airports|configure patches -> construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[Main/en/openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>
[patches]
always_small_airport = true
</pre>
