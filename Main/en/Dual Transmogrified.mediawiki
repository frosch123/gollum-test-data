[[Translation:Main/en/Dual Transmogrified]]{{en/Junctionsmenu}}
The '''Dual Transmogrified Junction''' is a variation of [[Main/en/Transmogrified]] junction for double mainlines. This junction doubles the number of "junction squares" (the distinguishing feature of Transmogrified junction) to 4 and makes use of both bridges and tunnels to make it more compact.

Another version of Dual Transmogrified junction is combination of [[Main/en/Transmogrified]] and dual version of [[Main/en/Half Transmogrified]] junctions.
