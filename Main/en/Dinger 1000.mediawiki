|Capacity=130 passengers & 45 bags of mail
|Description=Futuristic and Fictional. Apparently by Dinger/Fokker. Higher capacity than concorde, but not by much. Fastest and most expensive plane; for high-volume routes the bottleneck is at the airport, which in the long run favors the [[Main/en/Dinger 200]]'s larger capacity.
|Real-life=Fictional
