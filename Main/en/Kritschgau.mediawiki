|description=Kritschgau - a metropolitan mass transit scenario. City of 310 000, made up of numerous districts interconnected with highways. I've always wanted to fiddle with a scenario where there would be no intercity trains, only local commuter trains and RV's (incl. trams). That's why I created this one.

The scenario utilizes [http://jupix.info/openttd/scenarios/kritschgau/grf.png some NewGRFs]. Compatible versions of these GRFs are included in the scenario package. Additional RVs, trams and such are not included - please use your preferred set when playing.
