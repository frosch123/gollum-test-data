[[Translation:Main/en/Inflation]]
{{en/-}}
Inflation, as in the "real" world, causes prices to go up as time passes. There is a patch for turning this feature off.

*In versions prior to 0.7.0, the patch is controlled from [[Main/en/Configuring patches/Economy|Configure Patches > Economy]].
*Versions 0.7.0 and later have this feature under [[Main/en/Advanced Settings/Economy|Advanced Settings > Economy]].
*You can also edit the [[Main/en/openttd.cfg]] file and use the following syntax to disable inflation:
<pre>[economy]
inflation = false</pre>
