{{Template:Junction_Criteria|Cheap|1|2|2|4|1|0|1|1|0|0|3||Broken down trains can block up to all directions except one.|
*Tunnels can be replaced with bridges, but the drawback is that [[Main/en/signals]] cannot be placed on the ramp of the bridge.
*The central track should be long enough for the longest train to fit inside. Otherwise, remove signals at the central tracks.

===Pros===
*Can handle several trains at a time, thanks to [[Main/en/Signals#Path signals]].
*Very easy to upgrade from the simple junction described above.

===Cons===
*Level track crossings still present.
