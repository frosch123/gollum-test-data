[[Translation:Main/en/Path backoff interval]]
{{en/-}}
Ticks between checks for a free path. 

Default is 20. You may increase this if you have a slow computer, as a small value tends to put a heavy load on your processor. However, large values will also tend to cause trains to wait, ignoring paths that become free. Disable path lookahead entirely by setting to 255.
