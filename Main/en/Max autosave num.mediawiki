[[Category:en/Settings & Preferences]]

This [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] defines maximum number of automaticly saved games (autosaves) in \OpenTTD\save\autosave\ directory.  

== Description ==

[[Main/en/OpenTTD]] can automatically save the game every set period of time. Naturally, more saved games means much more disk space used. This [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] limits the number of saved games.

If all savegame slots are already used, older savegames will be overwritten (oldest first).

This setting is not used if [[Main/en/Keep all autosaves]] is used.

== Use ==

The value is set to 16 by default. You can change it by using the following syntax in [[Main/en/openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
max_autosave_num = value</pre>
