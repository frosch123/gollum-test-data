Boats can travel inland on rivers and canals. Rivers are created when the world is generated, and you can build canals on any flat tile of land.

Rivers run downhill, but ships cannot climb their slopes. Locks allow ships to change elevation and are needed for both rivers and canals. Aqueducts are bridges for ships.

Canals, locks, and aqueducts are expensive but quite useful for connecting bodies of water or allowing ships to access inland industries.

==Building canals==
# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar.]]
# Click on the ''Build canal'' button [[File:en/Build canal.png]]. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.
# Place the cursor on any flat tile of land and then left-click to place the canal tile. You can also click and drag to place longer stretches of canal.<br/>[[File:en/Building-canals-1.png|frame|none|Building a canal.]]

Once the canal is built, it's time to connect it to a lower level of water using locks.

If you need to build a dock - for example once the canal is close enough to the industry you're targeting - then just build a large (and expensive!) area for the ships to manoeuver and to build the dock, like in the next picture:

==Building locks==
# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar]]
# Click on the ''Build lock'' button [[File:en/Build locks.png]].
# Now find a suitable location for the lock. A lock requires two full flat tiles connected by a single slope.<br/>[[File:en/Building-canals-2.png|frame|none|Suitable lock location.]]
# Click on the slope to build the lock.<br/>[[File:en/Building-canals-3.png|frame|none|The lock.]]
# Repeat steps 3 and 4 to place more locks if necessary.

==Aqueducts==
''Aqueducts'' are bridges for boats. 

# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar.]]
# Click on the ''Build aqueduct'' button [[File:en/Build aqueduct.png]].
# Place your mouse where you want to start the aqueduct. White squares show where the aqueduct will be built. Unlike with bridges for trains or road vehicles, you do not need to click and drag to the other endpoint.[[File:en/AqueductConstruction.png|frame|none|Aqueduct construction.]]
# Left click to build the aqueduct.[[File:en/AqueductCompleted.png|frame|none|A completed aqueduct.]]
