===1.5.3 (2015-12-01)===
(None)


===1.5.3-RC1 (2015-11-01)===
* Fix: When selecting a refit cargo for orders, do not check whether the vehicle is in a depot or station, and do not ask whether the vehicle currently allows station-refitting. Also hide the refit cost for orders, it is not predictable (r27428)
* Fix: Use the NewGRF railtype sorting order in the infrastructure window (r27427)
* Fix: Crash when switching to or taking over companies, when an order window of a vehicle of the new company was opened. Now close those windows {{en/Flyspray|5842}} (r27425)
* Fix: Towns did not connect roads to existing roads, unless they had only a single roadbit. Otoh, towns also tried to connect to single roadbit tiles such as tunnels and depots, even though they were not connectable in the direction of interest {{en/Flyspray|6374}} (r27424)
* Fix: When towns expanded single-bit roadtiles using a grid-layout, they used the layout position of the neighbouring tile (r27423)
* Fix: Aircraft picked the wrong airport entry point, if airports were rotated by 180 degree {{en/Flyspray|6341}} (r27422)
* Fix: Consider text and icon sizes when drawing the client list {{en/Flyspray|6265}} (r27421)
* Fix: GrowTownAtRoad sometimes returned false, even when a house was built {{en/Flyspray|6362}} (r27420)
* Fix: CmdSellRailWagon did not revert all actions properly when no orderlist could be allocated {{en/Flyspray|6369}} (r27419)
* Fix: Desync due to incorrect storage of segments with different railtype in the YAPF cache {{en/Flyspray|6329}}, {{en/Flyspray|6379}} (r27418)
* Fix: When a dedicated server was paused with no clients, the master server advertisement interval was slowed, causing deadvertisement of the server {{en/Flyspray|6368}} (r27400)
* Fix: [Makefile] Game script directory and compat*.nut were never installed on *nix (r27399)
* Fix: There are two different availability conditions for fdatasync in the manpage. Use them both, since at least on some MinGW versions one is not enough (r27389)
* Fix: win32 sound driver failed to report errors (r27383)
* Fix: Clickareas in settings tree were misaligned when the filter warning was displayed, if the setting height was defined by the icons instead of the font {{en/Flyspray|6358}} (r27366)
* Fix: Center settings filter warning also vertically, and also in case of multiple lines (r27365)
