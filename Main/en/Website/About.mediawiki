Features
OpenTTD is modelled after the original Transport Tycoon game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by TTDPatch while others are original.

Significant enhancements from the original game include for example:

    * bigger maps (up to 64 times in size)
    * stable multiplayer mode for up to 255 players in 15 companies or as spectators
    * dedicated server mode and an in-game console for administration
    * new pathfinding algorithms that makes vehicles go where you want them to
    * autorail/-road build tool, improved terraforming
    * canals, locks, aqueducts
    * larger, non-uniform stations and the ability to join them together also at distance
    * mammoth and multi-headed trains
    * clone, autoreplace and autoupdate vehicles
    * possibility to build on slopes and coasts
    * advanced/conditional orders, share and copy orders
    * longer and higher bridges including new ones, full flexible tracks/roads under bridge 
    * reworked airport system with many more airports/heliports (i.e. international and metropolitan)
    * presignals, semaphores, path based signalling
    * support for almost all TTDPatch's newgrf features
    * drive-through road stops for articulated road vehicles and trams
    * plant multiple trees on one tile
    * bribe the town authority
    * lots and lots of advanced and configuration settings to tune the game to your liking.
    * save games with zlib compression for smaller sizes which does not interrupt gameplay
    * big support for internationalisation. OpenTTD is already translated into more than 40 languages
    * dynamically created town-names in 18 languages and newgrf support
    * complete replacement of the dump AI concret the AI can now be replaced by your own creation (there are already some usermade AIs available)


Lots of effort has been put into giving OpenTTD a better usability. These include:

    * BaNaNaS (Basic graphics And NoAI-AIs And NewGRFs And Scenarios) This content is now directly downloadable over the client.
    * convert rail tool (to e-rail, monorail, and maglev)
    * drag&drop support for almost all tools (demolition, road/rail building/removing, stations, scenario editor...)
    * sorting of most lists based on various criteria (vehicle, station, town, industries, etc.)
    * mouse wheel support (scroll menus, zoom in/out)
    * autoscroll when the mouse is near the edge of the screen/window
    * sell whole train by dragging it to the dynamite trashcan
    * cost estimation with the 'shift' key
    * advanced options configuration window, change settings from within the game

Graphical/interface features:

    * screenshots can be in BMP, PNG or PCX format (select in game options menu)
    * more currencies (including Euro introduction in 2002)
    * extra viewports to view more parts of the gamefield at the same time
    * resolution and refresh rate selection for fullscreen mode
    * colourful newspaper after a certain date
    * colour coded vehicle profits
    * game speed increase (through fast forward button or by pressing the TAB key)
    * snappy and sticky windows that always stay on top and neatly align themselves to other windows
    * more hotkeys for even less mouse-clicking 
    * support for 32 bit graphics

Posting a full list would be futile as it would mean updating this page almost daily, and even then some things might be forgotten. Play with the game to experience all the features yourself, or look further at wiki.openttd.org for a more thorough listing and explanation of the features and possibilities ingame.
