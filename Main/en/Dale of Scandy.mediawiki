|description=A very nice map with an interesting shape. It might be a bit of a challenge to connect the isle in the center of the map without massive terraforming. This map was also released with OpenTTD from version 0.4.5 to 0.4.8.
[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/openttd/openttd-0.4.8-scenarios.zip Download] this scenario together with all the other maps from the 0.4.8 release.
