(None)

===1.2.2-RC1 (2012-08-01)===

* Fix: In some cases ships could be covered with land {{en/Flyspray|5254}} (r24449, r24439)
* Fix: Copy constructor and assignment operator cannot be implicit template specialisations {{en/Flyspray|5255}} (r24448)

* Fix: CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS ignored for helper binaries (r24432, r24429, r24427, r24365)
* Fix: [Windows] Unbreak NewGRF MD5 sum calculation. Macros and side effects do not mix, especially if there is some obscure '#define min' in a windows header that nobody thinks of {{en/Flyspray|5231}} (r24416)
* Fix: Disallow removing roadtypes from bridges when not dragging in bridge direction {{en/Flyspray|5221}} (r24414)
* Fix: Draw wires under low bridges if the bridge is transparent, not if the wire is transparent (r24403)
* Fix: Station properties 11 and 14 were combined incorrectly {{en/Flyspray|5243}} (r24402)
* Fix: [Windows] Changing resolution did not resize the window (r24394)
* Fix: Use the 'all vehicles' group for the autoreplace window from the vehicle list {{en/Flyspray|5239}} (r24392)
* Fix: Do not consider not finding a particular base set critical; just load a different one and display an in-game error later on {{en/Flyspray|5233}} (r24388)
* Fix: Make IsInDepot() functions behave consistent across vehicle types and add IsChainInDepot instead, if that is what shall be checked {{en/Flyspray|5188}} (r24384)
* Fix: Call Vehicle::IsStoppedInDepot only for the first vehicle in a chain (i.e. primary vehicle or free wagon) (r24382)
* Fix: Do not resize the object GUI when selecting objects. Rather clip the object name (r24379)
* Fix: ReInit could crash for windows with NWidgetMatrix widgets {{en/Flyspray|5218}} (r24378)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Extended action A1 did not work correctly {{en/Flyspray|5227}} (r24369, r24361)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Ship-specific 80+x variables were missing for unknown reason {{en/Flyspray|5224}} (r24360)
* Fix: When airport construction was denied due to noise, the error message named the wrong town (r24354)
* Fix: [NoAI] A TileIndex is not a station id, so do not use it as one {{en/Flyspray|5215}} (r24353)
* Fix: When highlighting the drop position for vehicles in depots, make space for all articulated parts (r24352)
* Fix: Short vehicles were not properly positioned at the cursor when dragging for RTL languages (r24351)
* Fix: EQUALSIZE widget containers within EQUALSIZE containers were initialised with wrong sizes (r24346)
* Fix: The cursor in the company password window was not blinking due to wrong magic constants (r24335)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Change the length of 8/8 roadvehicles in vehicle lists to 32 pixels; this is in fact the correct length as can be seen in corners for short articulated parts following each other {{en/Flyspray|2553}} (r24332)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Group vehicles in the purchase list properly by source GRF, but also consider engine GRFID overrides {{en/Flyspray|4254}} (r24330, r24321)
* Fix: Make the AI settings window behave more like the other settings window by closing the query window whenever selecting a different row (r24315)
* Fix: Editing NewGRF parameters using the query window showed wrong values, if there was no direct relation between parameter index and parameter register (r24314)
* Fix: Center object previews in 1- and 2-view selectors based on the 4-view selector layout {{en/Flyspray|5057}} (r24299)
* Fix: Increase the left and right margins of the text in the yes/no query window (r24293)
* Fix: [NewGRF] GetReverseCargoTranslation() was unnecessary complicated and also returned the wrong thing for cargos not present in the translation table (r24273)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Load cargo- and railtype-translation during both reservation and activation stage. That way they can be selected using Action7 depending on present cargo- or railtypes (r24272)
* Fix: Use the same colour scheme for the script selection window as in other comparable windows (r24268)
* Fix: Make the oilrig-vehicle list accessible to spectators and colour its caption neutrally grey {{en/Flyspray|5126}} (r24260)
