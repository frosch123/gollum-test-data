[[Translation:Main/en/Requested features]]


==How to request a feature==

Things to know:

* OpenTTD is mature and stable, with clear goals. https://wiki.openttd.org/FAQ_development#What_are_the_goals_of_the_official_branch.3F
* The chances of a successful feature request are very low.  Only features that interest one or more developers will make it into the game.  The most likely trajectory for a feature request is one of:
*# explicit rejection with a reason given - we do just politely close a lot of requests, otherwise the issue tracker overflows and becomes useless
*# it's read, but nobody replies because they don't feel able to comment usefully, or don't want to cause offence by rejecting
*# nobody is aware of it and it's not even read - there is no-one who has volunteered to read and respond to all feature requests

This can be demoralising, so it's much better to know this in advance. :)  We don't want to waste anyone's time.

If you do have a feature request and want to patch:
#Ensure you are playing the latest [[Main/en/nightly]] version of the game so that you know what's already been done.
#Check that it's not already posted in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=32 suggestions forum].
#Check that it's not in OpenTTD GitHub issues - either  in the [https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues open] or [https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed closed] statuses.
#Join the OpenTTD IRC channel - instructions here https://wiki.openttd.org/Irc IRC is the best way to discuss features.
#'''Do not create a separate article for your suggestion. It will be deleted.'''
#'''Do not create a suggestion that has already been rejected. [[Main/en/Rejected features]] stay in this list, but with a "rejected" note instead of the percentage.

==Outdated List of requested features==

This is a very outdated list of previously discussed suggestions.  This list is not maintained in the wiki as of 2019, and is left here for historical interest.

Requested features that have already been rejected are marked as '''Rejected' or "Not needed"''. Please do ''not'' request those features here or in the forums again.
