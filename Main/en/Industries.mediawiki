[[Translation:Main/en/Industries]]{{en/-}}{{en/Table of contents}}

:''This article is about the concept of an industry in OpenTTD.  For a categorised list of industries, refer to [[Category/en/Industries]]''

'''Industries''' are entities that produce specific [[Main/en/cargo]]s and/or services. There are three types of Industry in OpenTTD; Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. Primary industries, such as mines, provide resources without requiring anything. These resources are then transported by a [[Main/en/Transport Company|transport company]] to a Secondary Industry. Sometimes, Secondary Industries will provide a resource that will either be transported to Towns (goods or food), or to a Tertiary industry. 

Your company only ''transports'' cargo on behalf of the manufacturers. Any profits you make are purely from the transportation fees you charge, not from the sale of the cargo.

The industry windows shows two numbers about the production of each cargo type that is created by the industry, these are total values from the last month. The first one is the produced amount. It varies due to internal factors of the industry. During an [[Main/en/Economy#Recession|economic recession]] there's only half of the usual production.

The second value is the percentage of the produced amount that has been delivered to the nearby stations for distribution. Industries may decide to keep back part of the production and not deliver it to any station.

The growth of the output of primary industries depends upon the percentage of cargo transported away from them. The more you transport, the faster it grows in the long term on average.

Details on the calculation of the mentioned numbers can be found on the [[Main/en/game mechanics]] page.

==Funding New Industries==
It is possible for a sufficiently rich transport company to fund the construction of a new industry, which will take place when and where you indicate. However, you won't get any immediate return on your investment (such as profit share) except the added cargo to transport. You don't own the facility either meaning that you are not normally allowed to destroy it, so ensure you place it in the correct location!

Normally, you may only fund the following [[Category/en/Industries|industries]]:

To fund a new industry in-game, hold down the ''Industries'' toolbar button [[File:en/Manual html m4d6ba21e.png]] (see ''Company and industry information'' on the [[Main/en/Game interface|Game interface]] page) and select ''Fund New Industry''.

Several settings change the rules of building new industries:	
* [[Main/en/Build raw material industries]]
* [[Main/en/Multiple industries per town]]
* [[Main/en/Same industries close]]

==Prospecting New Industries==
As of version 0.6.1, you now can ''prospect'' new industries. Funding new industries and prospecting have two major differences.  Firstly, prospecting is only used for primary industries (i.e. raw materials), and secondly, you cannot set the place for a prospected industry⁠—it will be set up wherever your prospectors first discover the correct natural resources, or sometimes not at all.

You can enable this feature in-game from patch settings window ''economy'' tab, ''Manual primary industry constructing method'' which can be on three settings: ''none'', ''as other industries'' and ''prospecting'' (default).
