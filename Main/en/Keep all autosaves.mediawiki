This [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] makes unique savegame names so none of them are overwritten

== Description ==

[[Main/en/OpenTTD]] can automaticly save game every set period of time. Naturally, more saved games means much more disk space used. This [[Main/en/Advanced Settings|setting]] can use a lot of disk space

This setting will make [[Main/en/OpenTTD]] ignore [[Main/en/max autosave num]]

== Use ==

The value is set to false by default. You can change it by using the following syntax in [[Main/en/openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
keep_all_autosave = true/false</pre>
