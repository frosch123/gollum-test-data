This document list various GS ideas. Some may end up being implemented while others may never become anything more than just ideas.

== Goal ideas ==

=== Goal Window ===
* Add a new main toolbar button which opens up company specific goal windows in the same way as eg. the economy window work
* Allow GS to mark goals as completed
* Add a column for goal progress

=== Towns ===
* Allow town growth goals that connect to the completion of a specific GSGoal goal.
* Maybe allow town growth goals to take an optional inhabitants parameter that will only make the restriction activate when the town population reaches this number.

=== Company League / Detailed performance window ===
* Allow GS to register items for the detailed performance window
* Allow GS to set the current score on these items
* OpenTTD computes the performance rating based on these items instead of the default items
