{{note|This needs a much better picture}}
This is a pre-signaled modified cloverleaf, with the possibility of U turns on special tracks. It's based on the [[Main/en/Building depots#Advanced depot configurations]] which uses pre-signals to give priority to the trains on the main line. The exits from the mail line are before entrances, reducing traffic problems (Fig.1).

'''Pros:'''
*Traffic jams less likely.
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Exits from main line are before entrances, reducing the chance of traffic problems.


'''Cons:'''

*Very costly to build.
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Trains must slow down during sharp turns.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[Main/en/Waypoints|waypoints]]).
