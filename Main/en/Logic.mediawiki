One day I thought - we have logical ''OR'', why don't make logical ''NOT'' and ''AND''? It's... challenging.

''(Here and afterwards I assume green color as ''TRUE'' and red as ''FALSE'')''
==OR==
[[File:en/Logic.or true true.png|left|frame|Arguments are ''TRUE''/''TRUE'']]
The basic ''OR'' is simply created by a one [[Main/en/pre-signals|pre-entry signals]] and two pre-exit signals.
[[File:en/Logic.or true false.png|128px|thumb|left|''TRUE''/''FALSE'']]
[[File:en/Logic.or false true.png|128px|thumb|left|''FALSE''/''TRUE'']]
[[File:en/Logic.or false false.png|128px|thumb|left|''FALSE''/''FALSE'']]
<br style="clear:both" />
==NOT==
[[File:en/Logic.not true.png|left|frame|Argument set to ''TRUE'']]
This looked easy at first, but it took a long time to create this structure.

Here '''n1''' and '''n2''' are the stations for maglev to run between. (Orders set to "[[Main/en/non-stop]]", TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling set to "on"). Notice, that '''n1''' has two platforms. This is why we can't use [[Main/en/waypoints]], and this is why we need TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling.

'''a''' and '''b''' are [[Main/en/pre-signals]], they stop the train, if argument is ''FALSE'' and move him out of the track.

'''x''' and '''y''' collect the position of the train and close the result signal.
Unfortunately, I've found out a little bug in this scheme. At some times, it [[Main/en/Image:Logic.not bug.png|jams]].
[[File:en/Logic.not false.png|128px|thumb|left|Argument set to ''FALSE'']]

<br style="clear:both" />
==AND==
[[File:en/Logic.and true true.png|left|frame|Arguments are ''TRUE''/''TRUE'']]
One solution was to make ''A AND B'' as ''NOT((NOT A) OR (NOT B))'', but that would be messy, so I have found out another solution.

Here '''a1''' and '''a2''' are the stations for maglev to run between. (Orders set to "[[Main/en/non-stop]]", TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling set to "on"). Notice, that both stations have two platforms. This is why we can't use [[Main/en/waypoints]], and this is why we need TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling.

'''a''' and '''b''' are [[Main/en/pre-signals]] (so are '''aa''' and '''bb'''), they stop the train, if argument is ''FALSE'' and move him out of the track.

'''x''' and '''y''' collect the position of the train and close the result signal.

Unfortunately, I've found out a little bug in this scheme, too. At some times, it [[Main/en/Image:Logic.and bug.png|jams]].
