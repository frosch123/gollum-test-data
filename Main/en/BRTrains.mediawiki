==GRF History==
Development began in April 2016, with the goal to finally use all the vehicles created for various real-world liveried train sets over the years, into a fully coded set which could build and grow over time.

The set draws artwork for numerous different artists from the tt-forums community, yet all drawn to the same scale - kinda.

*A Full Array of British Rail Classes (and sub-classes) covering the history of British Railways
*Real-World Liveries for each Class, Refittable at the Player's Choice.

*Vast Collection of Rolling Stock covering all standard TTD cargo classes. Later to include ECS/FIRS/etc.
*Custom sounds for some trains.
