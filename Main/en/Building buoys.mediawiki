[[Translation:Main/en/Building buoys]]{{en/-}}{{en/Tutorial}}
Now that you have some [[Main/en/Building docks|docks]] and a [[Main/en/Building ship depots|ship depot]], it's time to place a few [[Main/en/buoys]]. Buoys serve as waypoints for ships and there are two main reasons to use them:
*The ship [[Main/en/pathfinder]] might not be able to find a route between two docks;
*Navigating between two locations close to each other reduces the CPU load because there are less possible routes.

==Finding a suitable location==
It's recommended to place buoys about every 20 tiles along the route that a ship should take. You might want to use a little more around complex bends. Don't over do it, as you have to place every buoy in the ship's [[Main/en/Orders|orders]].

And that's all there is to placing a few buoys! Now, lets buy a ship.
