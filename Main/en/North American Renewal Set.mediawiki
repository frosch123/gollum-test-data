The '''North American Renewal Set''' or '''NARS''' is a [[Main/en/NewGRF]] train set for all [[Main/en/climate]]s except toyland, drawn by [[Main/en/DanMacK]] and [[Main/en/PikkaBird]] and coded by PikkaBird.  The new (August 2008) version 2 is one of the first train sets to feature vehicles before 1920, with start dates as early as 1830 possible in recent OTTD nightlies.
