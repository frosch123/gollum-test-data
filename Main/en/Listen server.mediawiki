A '''listen server''' is a OpenTTD network game [[Main/en/server]] that runs in the same process as the game client, allowing a player to both host and participate in the game easily. Listen servers have some limitations that [[Main/en/dedicated server]]s do not have.

==Starting a listen server==
Select '''Start server''' from the OpenTTD '''Multiplayer''' menu. You may now generate a new map, start a scenario or load a game. Singleplayer saves can be loaded for multiplayer and vice versa.

==Configuring the server==
There are 3 ways to change the settings of a running server:
*Use the graphical user interface, just like a single-player game. All server options such as [[Main/en/net frame freq]] aren't available this way.
*Use the [[Main/en/Console#Multiplayer commands|console commands]].
*With [[Main/en/Console#Multiplayer commands|rcon]]. If the server sets rcon password, clients can also configure the server via rcon.

==Differences between listen and dedicated servers==
* Listen server runs in the same process as the game client, so at least one client is always in the game.
* [[Main/en/min active clients]] does not work on listen servers.
