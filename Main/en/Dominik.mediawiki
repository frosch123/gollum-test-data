=Dominik - OpenTTD Developer=
Real Name: Dominik Scherer

==Who am I?==
I'm a 23 year old computer science student from Bonn, Germany. I joined the OpenTTD development team in March 2004 as one of the first developers. Since then my main obsession has been bugfixing and enhancing usability. My most popular contributions were probably [[Main/en/Higher bridges|higher bridges]] and [[Main/en/Landscaping#Leveling land|level land]] but I've also brought drag'n'drop functionality to numerous tools, such as bulldozing, station building and tree planting. I have also been providing the Mandrake Linux RPM packages.

==His first words==
Dominik joined the project on Wednesday the 31th of March 2004 at 18:58:23, the same month that OpenTTD went public. After he had finished his first patch, fixing a save/load GUI bug, his first word were:

<pre>
<dominik81> Hi everyone! I've got my first patch for OpenTTD ready, but I'm 
            completely new to open source coding. _What_ do I need to include
            when I upload a patch to SF? Just the parts that I changed as text
            files?</pre>
