[[Translation:Main/en/Remove absurd road-elements during the road construction]]
{{en/-}}
Makes the [[Main/en/Local Authority#Fund local road construction|local road reconstruction]] program actually do something.  When this patch is active, after road works are finished in a road tile, unnecessary road pieces are removed.  Unnecessary road pieces are those leading into buildings, water, uncrossable railroads, etc.
