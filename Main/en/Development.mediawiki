==Development Docs==
There is no single source for OpenTTD development docs.  It's a complex project with a long history, and multiple APIs.

For developing the core game, the "OpenTTD Development Documentation" sidebar navigation on this page is a good entry point, providing:
* links to development docs on this wiki
* links to external sources such as OpenTTD GitHub (which includes some core development docs) and Doxygen


OpenTTD includes multiple APIs for developing add-ons / mod content.  The sidebar navigation on this page also provides links to "Content APIs (modding frameworks)".
