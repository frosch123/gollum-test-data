{{en/-}}{{junctionsmenu}}

'''The Branch-Merge Junction''' is a small improvement over the [[Main/en/Complex Star Junction]]. It branches right at the beginning of the junction and merges right at the end, allowing more trains into the junction at once while preventing deadlock; it uses tunnels instead of bridges so that maximum speed is not limited; it has fewer slopes per path (middle two left turn tracks do not need to climb slopes); and it also has a more direct path. Trains heading straight, turning right, or turning left all have dedicated tracks, which helps alleviate traffic. However, trains heading straight need to first turn right and are also slowed down by a hill.
This junction is built for speed at the cost of space.
