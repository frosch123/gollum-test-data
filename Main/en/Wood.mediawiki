In the [[Main/en/temperate]] climate, [[Main/en/Wood]] is used to make furniture (one of the many types of [[Main/en/Goods]]). Trees are cut down at the [[Main/en/Forest]] and transported by you to the [[Main/en/Sawmill]] where they are further cut up and made into useful products.

In [[Main/en/Climates#Sub-arctic]] regions, wood is not used for furniture but is instead sent to [[Main/en/Paper Mill|Paper Mills]] to be made into [[Main/en/Paper]].

In [[Main/en/Climates#Sub-tropical]] regions, wood must be supplied by the player using the [[Main/en/Lumber Mill]].
