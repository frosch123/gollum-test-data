=OpenTTD比运输大亨豪华版多了什么内容?=

OpenTTD 的制作参考了克里斯索耶(Chris Sawyer)所制作的运输大亨豪华版，并在它的基础上做出了巨大的提升. 除此之外，很多灵感也由[http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch] 而来. 你可以从这里看到OpenTTD与TTDPatch之间的比较 [[Main/en/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features|OpenTTD与TTDPatch间功能的比较]].

==重要的改进==

* 多版本 - OpenTTD有Linux 版, Windows, Mac OS X, OS/2 等多个操作系统下的版本，目前甚至做了Android版.
* [[Main/en/Autorail|铁轨自动建造工具]] - 你可以在任何方向上拖动鼠标从而建造铁轨，电脑会帮你在所选定的方向上建造。
* 地图更大, 最大可达 4096x4096.
* 基于从谷歌地球上下载的地形高度数据制作出的高度图，提供了更为真实的场景。主页 http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=27052  以及最新的文档 http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=92633 .
* [[Main/en/Water Transport Tiles|运河/水闸]] - 允许玩家在陆地上建造运河，从而使船舶在其上航行。
* 车站更大 - 车站可以制作的更长，并能容纳更多的月台.
* [[Main/en/Nonuniform stations|站台分离]] - 同一个站点的不同站台之间可以有短距离间隔。
* Ability to [[Main/en/Join train stations|join stations]] (of same width or length) - Building a station next to another station of the same type, width and lengths creates a single longer station.
* [[Main/en/Waypoints]] - A special piece of track which can be placed on branching routes to force a train to use a particular branch to reach its destination.
* [[Main/en/Mammoth trains|Mammoth trains]] - Trains can be much longer.
