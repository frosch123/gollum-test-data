[[Translation:Main/en/Transport Tycoon Deluxe]]
Argued by fanatics as one of the greatest games ever, it was written in 1995 by [http://www.chrissawyer.com Chris Sawyer].

The basic premise of the game is to make money. Lots of money.
How does one achieve this? By transporting various cargoes across the world by road, rail, air and sea.

The game starts in 1950, with a few steam trains and slow vehicles. The final score is calculated in 2050, by which time you can buy supersonic aircraft and [[Main/en/MagLev]] trains.

Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) has many extra features over its predecessor, Transport Tycoon (TTO), including an additional three different climates to play in and more vehicle variety.

However this was still not enough for some people, and so [[Main/en/TTDPatch]], and later [[Main/en/OpenTTD]] were created.
