[[Translation:Main/en/Requested features]]
This is a list of all discussed suggestions that may or may not make it into the game. If you think you have a new suggestion, '''please post it first on the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=32 forums]''' but first search the forum as this wiki page does not list all suggestions. You'll get more feedback there and if a lot of people like it, you can still put it here.

Looking for something to do?  Write a [[Main/en/Development|patch]] for one of these features!

Requested features that have already been rejected by the OpenTTD developers are marked as '''Rejected'''. Please do ''not'' request those features here or in the forums again. The reasons why a feature was rejected and further information can be found under [[Main/en/rejected features]].
