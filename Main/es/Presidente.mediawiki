[[Translation:Main/en/Transport Manager]]
In OpenTTD, you assume the role of the '''Transport Manager'''. You run a [[Main/en/Transport company|Transport Company]], and your goal is to reach 2050 with the highest possible score. This score is measured by your [[Main/en/Detailed Performance Rating]]. As it increases, you will get promoted from the Engineer level to the Tycoon level progressively. 

Below are the nine levels:
*Engineer
*Traffic Manager
*Transport Coordinator
*Route Supervisor
*Director
*Chief Executive
*Chairman
*President
*Tycoon

It is possible to change the look of your manager between male and female, and give a name to the manager. There are patches in progress allowing for even more face customisation, rather than the "Random" generation provided currently.
