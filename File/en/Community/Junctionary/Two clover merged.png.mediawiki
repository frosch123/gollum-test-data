A 6-way junction with two cloverleaves. The inner four "ears" of the cloverleaves have been made to overlap to conserve space. Signals in the ovals are removed to avoid deadlocks when two trains are doing a indirect left turn (loop right for 270Â°) at the same time.

Sharpest turn=2, and without direct right turns: Horiz. extent: 20, Vert. extent: 12, Squares effectively used: 240
ST=2 and with 4 direct right turns: Horiz. extent: 20, Vert. extent: 20, Squares effectively used: 328
