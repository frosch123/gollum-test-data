An 8-way junction using four compacted cloverleaves. 12 of the original ears have been made to overlap, forming 4 "ovals" and a center diamond area that are shared.

Sharpest turn=2, and without direct right turns: Horiz. extent: 20, Vert. extent: 20, Squares effectively used: 400<br>
You can add 4 direct right turns on the outsides, uses extra space.

This junction may be of use when laying four tracks ABAB style rather than AABB. (A/B indicating the direction of trains on each track). See also the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Double Cloverleaf]].
