OpenTTD GitHub contains [https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/master/COMPILING.md official instructions for compiling on supported platforms].

The official instructions aim for brevity.  This wiki contains additional help for compiling OpenTTD on various platforms, and may include known issues and workarounds.  

Alternatively help can sometimes be found by joining [irc://irc.oftc.net/openttd.compile #openttd] on OFTC.
