[[Translation:Category/en/Primary Industries]]

Primary [[en/Manual/Industries|industries]], such as [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine|mines]], provide cargo without requiring anything.  This OpenTTD definition is not quite the same as the traditional one in that [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Bank|Banks]] provide [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Valuables]] without requiring any input, but money is not a natural resource and so traditionally these are Tertiary, or service, industries.
