Primary [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Industries|industries]], such as [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Coal Mine|mines]], provide cargo without requiring anything.  This OpenTTD definition is not quite the same as the traditional one in that [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Bank|Banks]] provide [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Valuables]] without requiring any input, but money is not a natural resource and so traditionally these are Tertiary, or service, industries.
