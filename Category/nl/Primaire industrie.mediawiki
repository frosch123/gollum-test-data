Primary [[Main/en/Industries|industries]], such as [[Main/en/Coal Mine|mines]], provide cargo without requiring anything.  This OpenTTD definition is not quite the same as the traditional one in that [[Main/en/Bank|Banks]] provide [[Main/en/Valuables]] without requiring any input, but money is not a natural resource and so traditionally these are Tertiary, or service, industries.
