=== Help for industry console commands ===

The patch that enables these commands can be found at http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=32964

=== Synopsis ===

Invoke command on specified industry (industries).

Usage:

 industry &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;command&gt; [&lt;optional command parameters...&gt;]

Command can be:
{|
|  center        ||  Center main view on industry location (Aliases: centre)
|-
|  count         ||  Count industries matching given criteria. This command will do nothing, but you'll see how many industries are matched by the identifier
|-
|  info          ||  Show industry info on console. Some basic statistics like production, percent transported, etc ... are printed to console for each matched industry.
|-
|  open          ||  Open industry window (Aliases: show)
|}

Identifier is used to specify on which industry the command will be applied.
Identifier can be:
{|
| '''all''' or '''*''' || for all industries
|-
| ''name of town'' || for industries belonging to given town
|-
| ''ID of industry'' || for specific industry
|}
Operators '''&lt;''', '''&gt;''', '''&lt;=''', '''&gt;=''' and '''&lt;&gt;''' can be used instead of '''=''' for following matches:
{|
| '''percent='''[value] || for percent of production transported last month
|-
| '''production='''[value] || for production last month
|-
| '''thispercent='''[value] || for percent of production transported this month
|-
| '''thisproduction='''[value] || for production this month
|}

You can specify multiple match conditions before the command.
If you use more than one match condition, you have to separate them by 'and' or '&' parameter. Number of match conditions is not limited.

=== Some useful examples ===

{|
| ''' industry production>500 and percent=0 info    || Print details about industries with high production from which the goods are not transported
|}

Note: This help is for version 18 of the patch.
