<!--The '''Quad Branch-Merge Junction''' is the direct evolution of the [[Branch-Merge Junction]] and [[Dual Branch-Merge Junction]]; allowing four entrances and four exits, in essence doubling the appropriation power of a Dual Branch-Merge Junction.  Although still in its infancy, the quad branch-merge junction is able to handle quite a load of [[Mammoth trains|large trains]] (20 cars) with very few backups. ([[:Image:NewQBMJ.png|Figure A]])

Speculation of [[New Bridges|angled track]] in the [[nightly build]]s under existing [[bridges]] will allow at least a 50% increase in [[trains|train]] speed; eliminating eight turns that currently reduce it to below 100mph (161km/h).  The sharpest turns are illustrated in [[:Image:Sharpcorners.PNG|Figure B]]:
