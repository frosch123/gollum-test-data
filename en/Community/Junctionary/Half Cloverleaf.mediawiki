The '''half cloverleaf''' is, also known as a '''trumpet interchange''', as its name suggests, half of a [[en/cloverleaf]] junction. Trains have to do some looping.

===Pros===
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams not likely.

===Cons===
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Trains join the main line before leaving. This could cause traffic problems. (Not applicable to the 1 loop design)
*Trains must turn left to go right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Checkpoints|waypoints]]). This is no longer an issue with newer OpenTTD versions that use a more advanced pathfinder.

===Tips===
*Make the loops bigger and without sharp turns.
*Make one of the loops go the other direction, so the train doesn't have to loop around.
*Make the branches bigger to hold a complete train, so trains that are waiting at a red signal aren't blocking other trains.
