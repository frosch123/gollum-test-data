[[Translation:en/Archive/Lists/Requested Articles]]

If you're missing any articles, add a request to the list. Put a line or two to explain what you want the page to cover.

If you're bored and want to write something, just pick a topic from this list.  

==Requested articles==
Articles with a higher priority are on the top of the list.

* [[en/advanced rail networks]]
* Timeline. What years do each of the grfs start/stop in. What can you do
* Decent [[en/Archive/Other/Troubleshooting]] section
** In particular, details of where [[en/log files]] are, and anywhere else one might start looking.

Also see this list at [[en/Special/Wantedpages]].  This is a [[en/Special/Specialpages|special page]] that lists non-existent articles with red links pointing to them.
