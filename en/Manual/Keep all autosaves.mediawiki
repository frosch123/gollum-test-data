This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] makes unique savegame names so none of them are overwritten

== Description ==

[[en/Manual/OpenTTD]] can automaticly save game every set period of time. Naturally, more saved games means much more disk space used. This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] can use a lot of disk space

This setting will make [[en/Manual/OpenTTD]] ignore [[en/max autosave num]]

== Use ==

The value is set to false by default. You can change it by using the following syntax in [[en/openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
keep_all_autosave = true/false</pre>
