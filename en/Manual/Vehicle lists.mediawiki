[[Translation:en/Manual/Vehicle lists]]

When you open a vehicle list you will be presented with something like this (1). The top-right part of the window allows you to sort the list, the middle-right part is the list, and the button-right on the bottom lets you build new vehicles of that type.

==Sorting the list==
You can sort the vehicle list by the following criteria:
:*Number
:*Name
:*Age
:*Profit this year
:*Profit last year
:*Total capacity per cargo type
:*Reliability
:*Maximum speed
:*Model
:*Value (sum of values of all carriages)
:*Length
:*Remaining life time
:*Timetable delay

You can then list them in ascending or descending order by clicking the ''"Sort by"'' button.

==Vehicle status==
The colour of the vehicle number and the circle tell you a lot about the vehicle.
:*If the vehicle number is blue, the vehicle is in a depot.
:*If the vehicle number is red, the vehicle is getting old and should be replaced.

:*If the status shows a grey circle (TTD) / shows a blue ribbon (OpenGFX), the vehicle is less than two years old.
:*If the status shows a green circle (TTD) / shows 2 coins and a green plus (OpenGFX), the vehicle's profit was more than £10,000 ($20,000) last year.
:*If the status shows a yellow circle (TTD) / shows a coin (OpenGFX), the vehicle's profit was between £0 ($0) and £10,000 ($20,000) last year.
:*If the status shows a red circle (TTD) / shows a coin and a red minus (OpenGFX), the vehicle was losing money last year.

==Groups of vehicles==
