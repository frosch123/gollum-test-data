|Description=This is the first diesel engine capable of pulling heavy loads. It is weaker than the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Vehicles/UU "37"]]; hardly better than the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Vehicles/Ginzu "A4"]] and inferior to the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Vehicles/SH "8P"]]. It is best used for light or medium loads, filling the role of a "secondary workhorse", which the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Vehicles/Chaney "Jubilee"]] had in the beginning of the game.
