'''Grain''' is another food source that is generated by [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Farm|Farms]], like [[en/livestock]]. 

You transport it to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Factory|factories]] where it is made into bread and similar products, or pies if you deliver some livestock too. You will see these leave the factory under the general title of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Economy/Goods]].

==Background==
You can read more about grain at [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal None], and about pies at [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie None].
