'''Livestock''' are farm animals like cows, sheep, pigs and maybe goats. In the case of a temperate climate, they are transported from a farm to a factory where they are made into "[[en/goods]]", i.e. meat products, ready to be taken to shops. In the case of a sub-arctic climate, they are instead taken to a food processing plant that makes "[[en/food]]" out of them.
