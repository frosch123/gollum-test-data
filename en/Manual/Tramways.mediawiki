'''Trams''' are a feature  that allows you to construct [[en/Manual/Tramways]], which can be built on open ground and on existing road systems. To play with trams, you need an active tram vehicle [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]. As with other transportation systems, trams require their own infrastructure, including [[en/depots]].
''Trams will only appear in new games.''

Besides building on flat land roads, depots and stations can also be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|built on slopes]].

When laying tracks keep in mind that tramway cars need terminal loops to turn around and drive back. A terminal loop is built by laying a half tile of track. Although the loop seems to cover the whole tile on the map it's just a half tile internally. The half tile is always at the open end, i.e. opposite from the round end. This is important if you want to remove single track pieces. Laying more than one piece of track on a tile creates straight or curved track or a crossing and doesn't allow turning around.

==Building Trams==
Then, place a Tramway depot, construct a vehicle by clicking ''New Vehicles'', then select a vehicle and purchase it. It will be then placed into the depot and its vehicle window will be opened. Issue [[en/orders]] to it, and click on the bottom bar marked "Stopped" to start the Tram.
