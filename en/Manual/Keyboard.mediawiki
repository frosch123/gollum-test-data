'''keyboard''' and '''keyboard_caps''' are two variables of Openttd.cfg file:

The layout to use for the [[en/on screen keyboard]]. This is a client-setting only, available from r12425 or [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.7.0]].

==Use==

When nothing is entered, the program will use the default keyboard layout for your language.
* "keyboard" is the variable for the main keyboard layer
* "keyboard_caps" is for the layer that appears when the shift key or caps lock is pressed
The characters will appear on the keyboard layout in the same order as you entered them in the string.

<pre>
[misc]
keyboard = <String>
keyboard_caps = <String>
</pre>

'''Valid options:''' Any string with 50 displayable characters

'''Default:''' <empty>

If some of the characters are invalid a warning message will tell you about it and those characters will be reset ingame.

'''Example:'''
