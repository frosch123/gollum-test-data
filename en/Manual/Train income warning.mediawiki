[[Translation:en/Manual/Train income warning]]


This option will present a warning as a news message if a train's income has been negative recently, to enable you to find out why and correct the situation.

Note that this setting has been renamed from [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#Warn if a train's income is negative|Warn if a train's income is negative]] since OpenTTD 0.7.0.

To prevent this warning when operating a [[en/Manual/Feeder service|feeder service]], see [[en/Manual/Negative income with feeder service]].
