You can either play with your own company, or in [[en/co-operative]] mode with another player.

If you still can't resolve some NewGRFs you might want to try searching for it using the [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/ GRF Crawler].

*Click "New company" to start playing from scratch, OR

==Gameplay==
Once you are in the game, gameplay is the same with a few extra features.

Note that the game may pause sometimes. This can happen while new players join the game, when there are less than the minimum active clients, or when the server administrator or Game Script manually pauses the game. If the game is paused that is displayed as usually in the status bar. The reason appears in the message area at the bottom left of the screen. You can't change the pause state as a client. Nobody can use the fast forward mode.

===Chatting===
[[File:en/Ottdmulti9.png|center|none|frame|3. The Chat Display Area]]
*Start chatting by pressing Enter.  A text entry window will open above the status bar.
*Change who you talk to by using the client list; see below.
*Chat and connection messages display in the bottom left of the screen. Players text is the color of their company. Spectators' text is gray. 
*Open the [[en/console]] to see message history.
*SHIFT+ENTER (SHIFT+T) sends a message to all players, CTRL+ENTER (CTRL+T) sends a message to all team mates and ENTER (T) is customizable

===Client list===
[[File:en/Ottdmulti7.png|none|frame|The client list]]
*Open the company list [[File:en/Manual html 12e20f5b.png]] menu and click "Client list" to see which clients are connected and what company they are playing for.
*Click on a client to open another menu with the following options:

:*'''Speak to all''': Send a chat message to everyone.
:*'''Give money''': Give up to Â£20,000,000 to the selected client's company.

The client list also tells who the server is. If the server has a name next to it, that person is running a [[en/listen server]]. If the server has no name to it, then it is a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server|dedicated server]].

===Company password===
[[File:en/Company password input box2.png|none|frame|Enter your password here]]
*To prevent unwanted clients from joining your company, click the company list button and then the password button.  Enter your password here.
*To remove your password, set the password to nothing.
*You have to set your password on every server.

==Moving Between Companies==
As of OpenTTD 0.7.0 (or more precise since r15242) it is possible to move between companies/spectator and create new companies without having to rejoin the game

===New Company===
You can find the 'New Company' option in the company list, it is only available if you are a spectator. If the servers 'max_companies' limit has been reached, this option is grayed out
[[File:en/Move company create.png|none|frame|company list as spectator]]

===Join Company===
Every company window has a join button (only displayed if you are not in that company).
[[File:en/Move company join.png|none|frame|company join button]]
A padlock displayed next to the join button indicates the company is password protected. Trying to join this company will prompt you for the password.
[[File:en/Move company join pwprompt.png|none|frame|password protected company + pw prompt]]

===Join Spectators===
If you are in a company and want to spectate for a little, or plan to start a new company and must join spectators first, the company list now shows the item 'Spectate' where the 'New Company' item was listed before.
If the servers 'max_spectators' limit has been reached, this option is grayed out.

==Desync error==
A desync error occurs when one or more players move out of sync with the server. After a short while, the player will be ejected from the game with the following message:

[[File:en/Desync.png]]

Desyncs are always bugs in OpenTTD, which can be put into three classes: calling <code>(Interactive)Random()</code> in the wrong place, not rebuilding caches correctly, or coding errors like overflows. They are NOT caused by a too slow computer, too slow internet connection etc.

See [[en/Archive/Source/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Network/Desync debugging|Desync Debugging]] on how you can help to track and identify the bug.
