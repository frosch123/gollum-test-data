(Renamed to implicit orders)

OpenTTD r21642 added Automatic Orders.

Feature: concept of automatic station orders; add stub orders for intermediate stations and remove them when not visiting them anymore. This allows you to see what trains visit a station without actually having to order a vehicle to stop at all stations. Based on patch by fonsinchen
