Now that you have some [[en/Manual/Building docks|docks]] and a [[en/Manual/Building ship depots|ship depot]], it's time to place a few [[en/buoys]]. Buoys serve as waypoints for ships and there are two main reasons to use them:
*The ship [[en/pathfinder]] might not be able to find a route between two docks;
*Navigating between two locations close to each other reduces the CPU load because there are less possible routes.

==Finding a suitable location==
It's recommended to place buoys about every 20 tiles along the route that a ship should take. You might want to use a little more around complex bends. Don't over do it, as you have to place every buoy in the ship's [[en/Setting vehicle orders|orders]].

'''2.''' Click on the Place buoy'' button [[File:en/Place buoy.png]]. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.

And that's all there is to placing a few buoys! Now, lets buy a ship.
