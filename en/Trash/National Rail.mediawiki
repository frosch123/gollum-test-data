Project National Rail is a new project for OpenTTD which plans to recreate the National Rail network as a scenario. So far the project is in the early stages of development, as a suitable height map has not yet been found. The concept was created by Wasila and has so far generated moderate interest.

=== To-Do ===

*Find/create suitable heightmap
*Design a scale for towns
*Place towns and cities
*Design lines and place minor stations
*Design and create major stations, potentially using Google Earth for great accuracy.
