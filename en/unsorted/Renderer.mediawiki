[[Translation:en/unsorted/Renderer]]


The renderer in OpenTTD separates drawing routines from the screen. The renderer is selected by the [[en/blitter]] in use, i.e. an 8bpp blitter would activate the 8bpp renderer.

The following renderers exist in SVN:

* 32bpp
* 8pp
* null

Experimental renderers:

* opengl
