New Economy and Balancing

One of the first things that has been changed, is aircraft way of running.

r8973 "-Feature/Codechange: Changed the internal unit for aircraft velocities from 8mph to 1km/h (peter1138), also give aircraft realistic velocities (so that 1km/h is 1km/h independent of vehicle type) (peter1138). Introduce a flag to reduce aircraft speed in holding patterns to some realistic velocity. Use this flag for the city airport for the time being and make use of the different entry points for this airport type."
