==Template:expand usage==
#First clearly explain on the Discussion page what in particular needs expanding so there's a starter if people have questions.
#Then enter ''<nowiki>{{</nowiki>expand|notes<nowiki>}}</nowiki>'' inside  the article or section that needs expansion, with a brief summary.  
#*The summary needn't be too in depth - it's for the reader, the discussion page is for the editor. 
#*The summary should be a sentence or phrase that makes sense in when it appears just after "This article or section needs expanding." in the message.

This will add the article to [[:Category:en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Articles to be expanded]].
